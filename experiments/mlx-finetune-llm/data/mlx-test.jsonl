This paper is a review of optical methods for online nondestructive food quality monitoring. The key spectral areas are the visual and near-infrared wavelengths. We have collected the information of over 260 papers published mainly during the last 20 years. Many of them use an analysis method called chemometrics which is shortly described in the paper. The main goal of this paper is to provide a general view of work done according to different FAO food classes. Hopefully using optical VIS/NIR spectroscopy gives an idea of how to better meet market and consumer needs for high-quality food stuff. 1.

It likewise discusses the kind of site- specific choreographic process of opening up to what in everyday life is not apparent and left in the shadows that generated the writing. The objective of the choreographic process was to allow the impact of the bodily sense of being in contact with an urban location to permeate the authors\\u2019 activities in writing. To support this intention, they generated a phenomenologically informed performative score of experimental writing that aims at appreciating the vitality of the sensuous. The first part of the submission presents the actual choreographic writing as an evocative piece of choreography that can be read independently of the second part. This latter part contains an exploration into conceptions about choreography and writing. Here the article draws specifically on Jean-Luc Nancy\\u2019s insights to articulate the kind of phenomenological approach the authors engaged in. It aims at establishing their artistic process as a phenomenologically oriented method in expanded choreography and argues that the writing they generated exscribes their encounter with the Hakaniemi bank in Helsinki on a late\\nKeywords:\\nChoreography, writing, body, location, sense, exscription, phenomenology, Nancy\\nScriptum\\nThe spatial waters and skies pierce an urban landscape.\\nEdges, rigorously structured space.\\nMuddy deep water.\\nA challengingly cold breeze.\\nA loose stone paving.\\nA seagull swimming the bay.\\nThe hubbub of roaring cars.\\nA circumscribed islet tightly guarded by streets, lanes, alleys, bridges and a highway.\\nEfficient function.\\nA junkie stooping on the shoreline, freezing.\\nBoatless and shipless docks echo the past.\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"\\nAversive melancholy.\\nDo not fall under.

As previous research has shown, its mechanics are almost exclusively based on chance (Scholten et al 2019), and the rest is mostly speculation with game assets (Lee, Yoo and Jang 2019). This raises the question whether this game requires any skill, such as strategic planning. In my case study, I revisit the game system and perform a practice of playing it to differentiate between unpredictable (or \\u201caleatory\\u201d, as in Johnson 2018) and decision-making points in the game. I argue that mapping the journey of a player should complement analysis of the game system to assess the balance between skill and chance in a better-informed manner.\\nKEYWORDS\\nEthereum tokens kept in an Ethereum wallet (usually Metamask or the company\\u2019s own wallet Dapper).\"}, {\"page\": 3, \"text\": \"How CryptoKitties Are Actually Played\"}, {\"page\": 4, \"text\": \"I personally prefer for no other rational reason than aesthetic pleasure.\\nFigure 1: My Cat Codex\\nAs I learned from sources like CKBox, KittyHelper among other sources, I need a Featherbrain and a\\nGeneration 4, which is somehow valuable and probably can even sell with profit.\"}, {\"page\": 5, \"text\": \"Conclusion\\nREFERENCES\\nCaillois, Roger. 1961.
