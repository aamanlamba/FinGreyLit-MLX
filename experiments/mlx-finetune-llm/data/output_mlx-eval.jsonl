In source separated human urine, nutrient ratio is suitable for fertilizer use and nutrients are readily available for plants. In this study the aim was to acquire scientific data of the environmental impacts and nutrient potentials of wastewater separating systems, i.e. urine and blackwater source separation. At the same time, general acceptance on the use of human urine in agriculture wanted to be improved. In addition, the value of urine as a fertilizer was calculated. The focus of the study was on rural areas but comparison between different systems included also the nutrient potential of urban areas as well. Based on the results, human urine was found to be an environment friendly fertilizer. Applying source-separation systems in rural areas, four times more phosphorus and over thirty times more nitrogen could be recovered compared to the current wastewater treatment system. Furthermore, eutrophication impact is reduced to one fifth. However there is a risk of increased soil acidification but it can be minimized with advanced spreading techniques, like deep injection. The results of this study support the use of source-separation technologies for nutrient recovery. 1 Introduction\\nRecycling of nutrients is recognized as one of the key elements of the circular economy. This has been identified in several programs and targets nationally and internationally (Aho et al., 2015; EUR-Lex, 2015; Pantsar et al., 2016). Recent scientific discussion has brought up the question of the diminishing global phosphorus reserves and thus the urgent need to seek for alternative sources of phosphorus fertilization. Phosphorus is in many countries the limiting factor in food production. The availability of affordable mineral fertilizers is becoming more challenging and the prices are expected to rise (Cordell et al., 2011). It has been estimated, that there is relatively easily extractable phosphate rock reserves left for about 50-100 years (Cordell et al., 2009). Additionally, nitrogen fertilizer production is highly energy intensive. Therefore, we are soon facing a situation where more intensive nutrient reuse will be essential for producing food for the growing population. Thus, it is of utmost importance to seek means to reuse all human and animal excreta in food production in a safe and sustainable manner.\"}]}\n    <|eot_id|>\n                                  <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"}

In an attempt to bring gender into conversation with the concept of sphere of influence, the article shows the tensions between militarist masculinity and queer subjectivity. In House of Cards, the viewer can identify statecraft as mancraft, and see how nonnormative behaviour is written off statecraft.\\nThe article focuses on bodily performances as signs of different approaches to power, and argues that House of Cards reinforces a militarised ideal of power over in the everyday practices in and around the White House, as well as in the form of spheres of influence. The series produces a choreography of militarist performance, an imagery which reinforces the understanding of world politics as a terrain for establishing spheres of influence. In the series, spheres of influence become manifest through the exacerbating of patriarchal conduct and centralisation of power, as well as in the premise of building security on the basis of enmities and influence. Sphere of influence, thus, represents a form of masculinised order, pinned against feminised anarchy, leading not only to the subordination of the influenced state, but nonnormative subjectivities, in particular.\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"Introduction This article discusses how gendered states and their spheres of influence are produced in human form by the political television drama of Netflix House of Cards. I have chosen a popular culture artefact to look into spheres of influence because it represents states in the form of human bodies, and specifically, gendered bodies for popular consumption. I investigate the ways in which gender relates to different forms of power, and specifically power extended beyond the borders of a sovereign state, by connecting anthropomorphism (state as person) with feminist and queer theory on the gendered performance of the state. I argue that in House of Cards, spheres of influence are related to a militarised form of masculinity in which violent solutions are preferred and celebrated. I focus on season 3 which introduced spheres of influence in the form a US\\u2013Russia rivalry in the Middle East. I propose the following: House of Cards reproduces gender binaries in terms of power and leadership, which translates to the gendering of the state and its policy of asserting spheres of influence. Even though Frank and Claire Underwood each embody queer subjectivity (more than one sexuality), a binary logic of gender still permeates the understanding of (international) politics in House of Cards. Gender here is understood as \\u201ca system of symbolic meaning that creates social hierarchies based on perceived associations with masculine and feminine characteristics\\u201d (Sjoberg 2009a, 3) and more specifically, following Judith\\nButler, as a performance, the action which produces the actor through repetition and naturalisation (Butler 1999). In House of Cards manliness is choreographed and performed as the imperturbable and militaristic subject, the natural embodiment of power. The reading of House of Cards here adds an important element to the conceptual and empirical work on spheres of influence in this special issue, and elsewhere (Hast 2014), by reading configurations of power in bodily choreographies. A feminist critique of power over proposes that states and people without power of domination have other means available, such as power to resist and power with others or power as collaboration (Sjoberg 2009b). While power is typically related to the ideas of control, authority or the ability to rule and govern (Staeheli and Kofman 2004, 6), an expanded understanding of power suggests multifaceted, diffuse and relational power. Contrary to such broad view of power, the conceptualisation of sphere of influence assumes an \\u201cinfluencing state\\u201d having power over the \\u201cinfluenced state\\u201d. This is seen as a static and immutable relationship of paternalism over the governed and controlled (Keal 1983). House of Cards adheres to such an idea of power over the influenced states, a system of control and authority. At the same time, the choreography of Claire Underwood demonstrates how other forms of power exist, but they would need to be accompanied by a feminist agenda in order to challenge the role of women under the structures of power. The article first discusses how spheres of influence are gendered and militarised\"}]}\n    <|eot_id|>\n                                  <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"}

Low-educated workers tend to leave the labour market earlier than the high-edu- cated, which creates educational inequalities in the employment rates of older workers. Yet relatively little is known about how large these inequalities are and how they have developed across time. If the employment rates of older workers are rising but educational inequalities remain stable or increase, policymakers may need to reconsider ways of making the extension of working lives more inclusive. Studying educational inequalities in the employment of older workers across time is com- plicated by the fact that the educational structure of the population continues to change. Cohorts that now approach the retirement age have a considerably higher education than cohorts that retired fifteen years ago. This educational expansion has had a positive effect on extending working lives [1]. However, while it is possible that the overall inequalities between older workers in society have declined because the share of high-educated people has increased, the relative disadvantages for the low-educated groups may have remained the same or even grown in younger cohorts. Finland makes an interesting case for studying educational inequalities in employment for several reasons. While the employment rate in the age group 55\\u201364 years was only around 35 percent in the mid-1990s, it has increased to more than 60 percent in recent years. A series of pension reforms during this period explicitly aimed at extending working lives and increasing the employment of older workers. At the same time, over the past decades, the share of people who have completed tertiary education has risen drastically in this age group while the share of those with low qualifications continues to decline (see S1 Table in S1 File). Currently, Finland is one of the countries in Europe with the most highly educated older workforce. However, at the present, there is no information on whether the rise in the employment rate has occurred in all pre- or post-retirement-age groups and on all educational levels. Finland could forebode of how the educational inequalities in employment of older people will develop in other countries. This study explores employment of 60\\u201368-year-old men and women by educational level over the period 2006\\u20132018 and the magnitude of educational inequalities in employment. We propose a novel method to analyse both absolute and relative educational inequalities in employment. Using exceptional register data for the entire Finnish population allows us to observe employment rates in smaller-than-usual age brackets and to disaggregate these by gen- der and level of education. We analyse employment levels and educational inequalities among three age groups: 1) those that are approaching their retirement age (60\\u201362 years), 2) those that are eligible for an old-age pension but have incentives and often good opportunities to continue working (63\\u201365 years), and 3) those that possibly face increasing obstacles and disin- centives to continue working (66\\u201368 years). We observe trends in employment and educa- tional inequalities in these age groups between 2006 and 2018. This article is organised as follows. The following section introduces previous literature on educational inequalities in employment at older age and describes changes in the incentives for employment at older age in the Finnish pension system. Section 3 describes the data and methods. Section 4 presents our findings, which are discussed further in section 5. Background Educational inequalities in employment at older age Studies have identified numerous mechanisms behind the early exit and lower employment rates of low-educated older workers. First, a lower socioeconomic status is associated with poorer health, which may limit possibilities to continue work [17\\u201325].

Such writing is called many things, but I named it documentary poetry which, regardless of its origins, is a manifestation of the indeterminacy and autonomy of art. I have taken the words of Finnish military cadets, poetic in themselves, and exhausted the possibilities of translation by abandoning accuracy for the sake of sensual precision. The zealless yet unsettling depictions of combat are reassembled in poems troubling the mystique and exceptionalism of the military while pointing to the fragility of the military itself.
