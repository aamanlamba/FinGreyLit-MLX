Taxon: Parus major, Cyanistes caeruleus. Methods: We recorded clutch coverage estimates and collected egg covering nest material from the tit nests. We also measured nest specific breeding parameters and phenotypic measurements on adults. We tested whether mean spring temperatures, nest predation rates and flycatcher (Ficedula spp) densities in the study areas explain the large-scale geographical variation of clutch coverage and reproductive success of tits. Results: The degree of egg coverage of great tits increased with lower mean spring temperature, higher nest predation rate and higher flycatcher density. We did not find egg covering of blue tits to be associated with any of the ecological or abiotic factors. Moreover, egg covering of great tits was not associated with reproductive success in our cross-sectional data, yet a rigorous assessment of fitness effects would require long-term data. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that, in great tits, egg covering may simul- taneously provide thermal insulation against cold temperatures during egg-laying in spring and also represent a counter-adaptation to reduce information parasitism by flycatchers and nest predation. Hence, geographical variation in interspecific interac- tions, and consequently in co-evolutionary processes, may affect the evolution of nest characteristics besides environmental conditions.

This paper is a review of optical methods for online nondestructive food quality monitoring. The key spectral areas are the visual and near-infrared wavelengths. We have collected the information of over 260 papers published mainly during the last 20 years. Many of them use an analysis method called chemometrics which is shortly described in the paper. The main goal of this paper is to provide a general view of work done according to different FAO food classes. Hopefully using optical VIS/NIR spectroscopy gives an idea of how to better meet market and consumer needs for high-quality food stuff. 1.

This paper will give an overview of some of these sources and their varied but generally positive discussion on Nijinsky's work in order to argue that these informed Russian spectators perceived Sacre in a manner that contests how this work has been represented in dance history.

Writing after a World War, both also separated the work from the tradition of Russian art, specifically the neo-nationalist art that many Russian critics emphasised in their reviews. This downplaying of nationalism is the most significant change in representations of Sacre ever since, and relates to issues of authorship and modernism that I will address here. As in any large production, who originated which aspect of the end product is, frankly, not a very interesting research question. The process of collaboration can be fraught with conflicts and creative disagreements invisible in the end result, and Nijinsky's letter alludes to these with the conditional \\u201cif all will be the way you and I have wished it to be\\u201d. As Nijinsky appraises the rehearsals with the dancers are going well, this hints at some other discord in the collaboration or within the company.2 It is very tempting to read such conflict in terms of the modernist myth of the vanguard young creators separating their ties to academic conventions and the habitual spectator Nijinsky mentions. This view has dominated interpretations of Stravinsky's score, but not of Roerich's neo-nationalist sets and costumes, which lack the necessary signs of aesthetic break attributed to both the music and the choreography.

Roerich, however, had sent the designs to Stravinsky, with the result that on 20.12.1912/2.1.1913 (in Stravinsky 1997, i:398), Nijinsky\\u2019s partner, the impresario Diaghilev, was still asking Stravinsky for the set designs, as well as issuing the ultimatum that were the composer not to show up in the rehearsals as Nijinsky requested, Sacre would not be performed. The company r\\u00e9gisseur, Grigoriev gave the lack of costume designs as the excuse for not beginning the rehearsals in a letter to Stravinsky 5./18.12.1912 Stravinsky 1997, i:390; cf. Stravinsky-Craft 1978, 93. Diaghilev renewed his request 10./23.3.1913 (Stravinsky 1997, ii:42), which means Nijinsky still had not had the designs. In this letter, Diaghilev also told Stravinsky that the presence of Roerich was not required in the rehearsals, which may explain why Roerich was not credited with the mise-en-sc\\u00e8ne of Sacre, even though the libretto had been written by him in collaboration with Stravinsky.\"}]}"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "{\"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"\\\"Great horizons flooded with the alien light of the Sun\\\" : Le Sacre du Printemps in the Russian context\", \"creator\": [\"J\\u00e4rvinen, Hanna\"], \"type_coar\": \"journal article\"}"}]}

Abstract Culturally and linguistically diverse healthcare students face challenges during clinical learning, and many studies highlight the need to investigate this phenomenon further. This study aimed to describe students\\u2019 experiences of the clinical learning environment and mentoring. Anonymous evaluations were gathered in written form during 2013\\u20132016. Data were collected from 133 culturally and linguistically diverse healthcare students, including exchange students and students studying in English language-taught degree programmes at eight Universities of Applied Sciences in Finland. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis. Students\\u2019 experiences were related to their mentors\\u2019 competence in mentoring, the culturally diverse pedagogical atmosphere, and aspects of diversity that influence clinical learning. Students reported that they had experienced social isolation, discrimination, bullying, sexual harassment and prejudice during their clinical placements.

Thus, schools are willingly co-operating with parties who can offer such activities. Museums, galleries and other cultural institutions using, for example, digital storytelling and augmented reality as part of their services, are willing to cooperate with schools by organizing extracurricular activities as one approach when trying to attract more visitors. We have developed audio platform, two different workshops and engagement measurement instrument to sup- port these cultural institutes in organizing engaging extracurricular activities. Our platform consists of an audio digital asset management system (ADAM), a management applica- tion, and mobile applications. The mobile applications are audio story sharing and audio augmented reality, which enable creating and sharing digital stories and soundscapes. As our audio platform aims to reach and activate young people, it is necessary also to co-operate with and motivate schools and teachers. Thus, structured and tested workshops, which fulfil extracurricular characteristics, will serve this purpose. In our case, we have developed two different workshops, which have a clear structure; are supervised by adults, and have pedagogical objectives for the participants\\u2019 skill development. We have applied the student engagement structure by Fredricks, Blumenfeld and Paris in order to find out the level of engagement in workshops. By observing participants and utilizing a questionnaire, which we have developed, it is possible to measure the level of three engagement components.\\nWe have tested our audio platform, workshop concept, and engagement measurement instrument in four separate events in Finland and Poland. The results are promising. There is a versatile audio plat- form, which is affordable for cultural institutions, and there is a concept to reach young people and a measurement instrument to measure the level of engagement in a workshop context.

Several studies have linked these activities to positive psychological and academic outcomes [1]. Adolescents who participate in the extracurricular activities during high school have higher self-esteem and lower rates of depression. They have higher grades, test scores, school engagement and educational aspi- rations. Thus, schools are willingly co-operating with parties who can offer extracurricular activities. To this end, cultural institutions, like museums and art galleries organize extracurricular activities for youth. These extracurricular activities are one approach to attract more visitors. At the same time, they develop new activities, such as context-aware audio guides, augmented reality and 3D modelling based applications, and interactive digital storytelling [2, 3, 4] to provide interactive experiences for an audience familiar with of digital interaction.\"}]}"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "{\"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"Engaging audio based mobile applications\", \"creator\": [\"Salo, Kari\", \"Neuvonen, Aura\"], \"year\": \"2019\", \"e-isbn\": [\"9788409147557\"], \"type_coar\": \"research article\"}"}]}
