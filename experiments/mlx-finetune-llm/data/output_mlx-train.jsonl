This motivates firms to adopt new strategies based on digital technologies; such new strategies are often referred to as digital transformation strategies (DTSs). Unlike with firms that were founded with a basis in digital, the implementation of a DTS at a traditional company can lead to entire changes in organizational structure, culture, and processes; how such changes happen remains an open question. As a result, this study examines how such changes were made during the process of implementing a DTS at a global Finland-based energy company. An interpretive case study employing different data sources is used. We contribute to the research by identifying changing patterns and key features in three phases of the process of implementing a DTS. In particular, the general pattern of this process is continuous incremental change; however, each phase of the process has different features, models and directions.

Derrida did not refuse the image just because it was an image and not a written academic text, but because the image had rather clumsily taken the place of what he thought \\u201ccould have and should have been elaborated more precisely with discourse or writing\\u201d3. The problem was that the video images didn\\u2019t manage to fulfil their argu- mentative role, they just appeared in place of discourse without adequately replacing it. During the course of their discussion, Stiegler and Derrida agree on the point that there doesn\\u2019t yet exist a \\u201cscholarly (if not scientific) practice of the image\\u201d but that in- tegration of images in research publications should, however, be encouraged \\u201cprovided that rigor, differentiation, refinement do not suffer as a result\\u201d4. Derrida sees that a new kind of research practice in medias res would be welcome and might actually emerge in wake of the quick technological developments in the areas of archiving and publishing. \\u201cThere will come a time when, in effect, one will be able to and will have to integrate images into the presentation of knowledge. I don\\u2019t know to what point this is impossible today, but in any case, it is still very limited\\u201d5. Of course, while this was certainly true for philosophical discourse in the 1990s, Stiegler and Derrida seem to neglect the fact that in some areas of research, such as cultural anthropology, images had made their way into research publications already decades earlier. Now, some twenty-five years later, we are in the situation where the epistemic op- erations involving images are not only much more widespread in various research con- texts, but also increasingly embedded in computational networks6. The Open Science movement, with its policies for open data management and dissemination guidelines, is gaining more and more weight in the international research landscape, which reduces the formative power of various access barriers and, in the best case, enables multifaceted approaches to medially embedded information and knowledge. Despite of the still he- gemonic position of the written academic text, research publishing standards are starting to embrace multimodal formats, enhanced texts and rich media presentations in many areas of research7. The buzzword \\u2018digital humanities\\u2019 signals a new orientation even in the traditionally very text-based humanities. Some of the proponents of this emerging research area argue that media literacy, that is, the capability for articulating passages from images and other media to text, is not enough for a humanities scholar today, a variety of digital methods and programming skills are needed as well. David Berry, the editor of Understanding Digital Humanities (2012), argues for \\u2018iteracy\\u2019, an iterative research practice that involves reflection on \\u201cwhat reading and writing actually should mean in a computational age\\u201d8. 2 Ibid., 142-143. 3 Ibid., 143. 4 Ibid., 143. 5 Ibid., 142. 6 These networks tend even to bypass the human viewer, which complicates the epistemic status of images beyond the scope of this article.

The practice of expositio is the foundational zoopolitical human gesture. It consisted of leaving new-born children exposed at street markets to be sold as slaves, or in nature, left to survive (or die). The spectres of those body-minds still haunt our onto-epistemologies: by creatively fabulating with Ludue\\u00f1a\\u2019s work, I suggest looking back to the broken chains of the production of able bodies instead of perpetuating the reproductive futurity. Ludue\\u00f1a\\u2019s work investigates how and why the figure of the spectre gradually disappeared from the discursive milieu, and why it needs to be brought back into the spotlight. Its potential resides in its existence between binary categories like God and human, man and animal, male and female. It queers, defying epistemological boundaries, what it means to be dead or alive. Melanie Yergeau employs the term \\u201cneuroqueer\\u201d to talk about the non-neurotypical and queer subjectivities that are a continuum of indiscernibility and are violently dislodged into binary categories.\\nIn the conclusion, I argue for operationalising the concept of the spectre to help to short-circuit the able- neurotypical and heteronormative futurism, looking back to the ghosts of the exposed children.\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"Queering the Ghosts of Typicality: The Disruptive Potential of Fabian Ludue\\u00f1a\\u2019s philosophy 75 \\u2013 insufficient and populated with inconsistencies, due to the complexity of his theoretical formulations.\\nAgainst the Anthropotechnical1 machine, I propose looking back to the ghosts of those who did not survive their expositio, as a gesture of queering the temporality, populating it with the failures of normalisation and looking towards other futures (or the lack of them).\\nAfter the Trend: The Revenant Spectre\"}, {\"page\": 3, \"text\": \"Spectral Not-yetness\"}, {\"page\": 4, \"text\": \"A Parenthesis: A Letter to Spinoza\"}, {\"page\": 6, \"text\": \"Fabricating Difference\"}, {\"page\": 8, \"text\": \"Queering the Ghosts of Typicality: The Disruptive Potential of Fabian Ludue\\u00f1a\\u2019s philosophy 81\\nConclusion: Glorious Liminal Bodies\\nFigure 1: crack, schism, rip(ping), cutting together apart\"}, {\"page\": 10, \"text\": \"Queering the Ghosts of Typicality: The Disruptive Potential of Fabian Ludue\\u00f1a\\u2019s philosophy 83\"}]}\n    <|eot_id|>\n                                  <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"}

In addition, willingness and drive to interact with people, nature and weather are crucial in the learning process along with speaking the language of the new culture.\\nAuthor: Shaidul Kazi\\nLearning a New culture \\u2013 A Crucial Measure for Adaptation\\nHuman beings\\u2019 inbuilt neural machinery drives them toward bonding with others. This bonding process instigates people to form groups. People form groups, among others, by binding together through links of family, friendship, work, style, sports teams, religion, and culture (Eagleman 2015, 163). A cultural link is a crucial background factor in forming groups. What is a culture? A culture is considered as something that is learned. It comprises norms and values and governs human behaviour to a particular-direction, does not change easily, which is characteristic of a particular-group, and is transmitted over time from one generation to the other (Kazi 2009, 97). The definition exposes that a culture is a learning outcome. Besides, culture is a group property. According to Kazi, values are the principal building block of a culture (Kazi 2009, 104). Social value and cultures are inseparable from each other.\"}, {\"page\": 3, \"text\": \"Learning a New culture \\u2013 Open the Doors for Survival\\nLearning a new culture is a type of change process, and resistance to change is very common.\\nFons Trompenaars, Philip R.

Although diffusion costs of renewable energy utilization are higher than fossil fuels and nuclear power plants, other policy aspects and operation costs of renewables cover this gap particularly in high dependent countries to fossil fuels. The current paper discusses the role of renewable portfolio in the Finland\\u2019s energy action plan during 2011\\u20132020. A system dynamics model is constructed to evaluate different costs of renewable energy utilization by 2020. Results show that total costs of new capacities of renewable energy systems as well as operation and maintenance costs of current systems bring 7% saving compared to total costs of new natural gas power plants (as a sample for second scenario) in Finland.

In fact, the potential of an event for starting a cascading failure depends on 20 many factors such as network structure, system operating point and nature of the event. In this 21 paper, based on the application of decision tree, a new approach is proposed for identifying 22 harmful line outages with the potential of starting and propagating cascading failures. For this 23 purpose, associated with each trajectory of the cascading failure, a blackout index is defined that 24 determines the potential of the initial event for triggering cascading failures towards power 25 system blackout. In order to estimate the blackout indices associated with a line outage, a three 26 stages harmful estimator decision tree (HEDT) is proposed. The proposed HEDT works based on 27 the online operating data provided by a wide area monitoring system (WAMS). The New 28 England 39-bus test system is utilized to show the worthiness of the proposed algorithm. 29 30 Keywords: Blackout; cascading failure; decision tree; harmful line outage. 1\"}]}\n    <|eot_id|>\n                                  <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"}

Since taking her doctoral degree 2004 she has published several articles and acted regularly as a visiting lecturer at the Teatre Academy, and at the Universities of Lapland, Tampere and Helsinki, where she also holds the title of docent in thea- tre studies. She studied scenography in 1980-85, worked as a full-time practicing designer 1983-2002, and was the professor of Stage Design in 2006-13 at the University of Industrial Arts, Helsinki (from 2010 at the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture). laurakgrondahl@gmail.com 86 Nordic Theatre Studies vol. 27: no. 2\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"Stage Design at the Crossroad of\\nDifferent Operational Cultures.\\nMapping the History of Scenography Education in Finland\\nLAURA GR\\u00d6NDAHL\\nI \\ufb01rst undertook this investigation out of person- and vision function as communicative and perform- al curiosity as a former student, practitioner and ative means; how the creative processes take place; teacher in scenography.

The working process might, for instance, produce unwelcome side- effects, like a possible heap of waste, not considered to be part of the actual work. 1 See Brad Haseman, \\u201cA Manifesto for Performative Research.\\u201d In Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy, theme issue \\u201cPractice-led-Research,\\u201d no. 118 (2006): 98-106; see also Barbara Bolt, \\u201cA Performative Paradigm for the Creative Arts?\\u201d\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"In discussions on performance documentation and on the changing notions of the live and the mediated, questions of the organically alive, the animate and the inanimate, are rarely posed.4 Nor is the importance of a living environment usually emphasized when the live encounter between performer and spectator is stressed.

Speaking about Reality: Verbatim techniques in contemporary Finnish documentary theatre LAURA GR\\u00d6NDAHL ABSTRACT During the past years, different modes of documentary theatre have gained popularity. A distinctive feature there is the use of verbatim texts, borrowed directly from authentic documents like recorded interviews or minutes, including sometimes even coincidental stuttering of the original speaker. In this article I analyse the verbatim-technique as part of the post-dramatic performance strategies. It makes it possible to focus on the materiality of language as a texture as well as an instrument for meaning making and communicating contents. It also gives a more active role to the audience. When texts are explicitly framed as authentic, and reiterated with exaggerated precision, the attention is drawn to the performative repetition of the speech acts. Thus, the verbatim performances do not so much refer to reality \\u201cas it is\\u201d, but rather stage acts of making claims about something we call reality. Borrowing Carol Martin, the contemporary generation of documentary theatre makers aspire to make relevant claims about social reality even if they use postmodern strategies and admit that truth and reality are not within their reach. I will discuss different strategies of using the verbatim techniques in documentary performances. I theorize the subject using well-known international examples, move on to a short overview of recent documentary theatre in Finland, and examine closer four cases: Parliament III in Ryhm\\u00e4teatteri in 201 5, Towards Work at Kouvolan Teatteri in 201 4, Ruusula Street 1 0 at Q-teatteri in 201 4, and My Palestine at Teatteri Takomo in 201 5.

Introduction\\nPublic attitudes are central to the legitimacy of political processes and democratic decision-making around social security systems. Politicians may be reluctant to propose and legislate social security reforms, for instance, if public sentiment is against them. But if public opinion is in favor and the proposed reforms are thought to be fair, then they have a better chance of making it through the political process of legislative amendment (see e.g. Svallfors, 2004; Brooks & Manza, 2006; Pierson, 2006; Hemerijck, 2013; Fern\\u00e1ndez & Jaime-Castillo, 2013; Chung et al., 2018).\\nIn order to have legitimacy, a social security program needs to be seen as credible and fair.

Moreover, the Scenario Filter Model (SFM) and its possibilities to produce future oriented service innovations and skill requirements are introduced. The scenario filter model (SFM) is a tool to generate a comprehensive set of scenarios and also to select ideas for further development and commercialization. The advantage of the SFM it that it combines three different perspectives so called filters: market, society and technology. The SFM also supports strategic decision making by helping e.g. in the timing of strategic actions. The research also gives new insights for services in the fields of citizen wellbeing and security by introducing four alternative scenarios and some examples of future service concepts which were created during this foresight process.

This type of \\u2018singing\\u2019 while learning to play an instrument may have similarities to the use of private speech in other types of learning tasks. This report describes a multiple case study based on the naturalistic observation of learners playing string instruments in different situations. We observed private rehearsals by six adult guitarists from different music cultures (classical, flamenco and jazz) who had different approaches to learning (traditional and constructivist). In addition, we observed the one-to-one lessons of a constructivist cello teacher with a 7-year-old beginner and a 12-year-old student. All sessions were recorded.

From the theoretical framework of private speech, we identified a set of qualities in private singing, such as whistling, humming, and guttural sounds, with different levels of audibility. Self-guidance and self-regulation appeared to be the functions underlying both psychomotor learning and reflective-emotional learning from an embodiment approach. Guitar learners from popular urban cultures seemed to use less explicit singing expression than classical guitar learners, the explicitness of which may be related to the instructional use of the notational system. In the one-to-one cello lessons, we observed a process of increasing internalisation from the younger to the older student. Both results are consistent with the literature on private speech, indicating that this process is a natural process of internalisation at higher literacy levels. Singing is not as frequent in music lessons as might be expected, and it is even less frequently used as a reflective tool or understood as an embodied process. The examples provided in this article shed light on the multiplicity of applications and on the potential benefits of private singing in instructional contexts as a powerful learning tool.\\nKeywords: embodiment, instrumental learning, music rehearsal, one-to-one lessons, practice session, private speech, singing, self-regulation, self-guidance 2\"}, {\"page\": 4, \"text\": \"Although private speech is audible, it is neither intended for nor directed to others.\"}, {\"page\": 7, \"text\": \"PRIVATE SINGING IN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC LEARNING\\nTable 2.

Finland is a world leader in the use of public electronic services. Continuous improvement to competencies is a prerequisite for the success of digitalisation in the service development sector. The increasing use of information technology in health and social care needs to be taken into account in the education of the health and social care sector work force. The mandate of the national SotePeda 24/7 project is to identify and define the informatics competencies required for multidisciplinary education of this sector in Finland. The project has adapted international recommendations for use in the national context. The national recommendation covers 12 areas of competency and related content. In addition to defining competencies, the project has produced a toolbox of materials for use by educators of these topics in universities that cover applied sciences and lifelong learning. The results of the project are expected to significantly improve the preparedness of graduating health and social care and related engineering and business sector students to make full use information technology, all of which benefits the national health and social welfare system.

Guadalupe L\\u00f3pez-\\u00cd\\u00f1iguez Sibelius Academy, University of the Arts Helsinki, Finland Pamela Burnard Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge, UK Abstract Making sense of musicians\\u2019 professional learning pathways is of crucial importance to understanding their career progressions, their routes into creative employment, and the relevance of various policies to their professional lives. However, this is a far cry from understanding how critical reflection catalyzes diverse learning routes, especially when considering evidence originating from postgraduate musicians\\u2019 own accounts of their journeys into job creation. In this study, we invited five postgraduate classical musicians who were invested in professional learning through performance programs in higher education to contribute these types of personal perspectives. The article explores the value of postgraduate musicians\\u2019 own accounts of their journeys and illustrates how a more nuanced understanding of them can be arrived at through the use of visual-based tools, for example, Rivers of Musical Experience and Dixit Cards. This constructivist intervention prompted both group and individual critical reflections, as well as sense-making processes that enabled the participants to become more informed about the (typically overlooked or neglected) critical incidents that differently catalyze professional learning pathways. All of the participants articulated sociocultural influences that were situated along historical, present, and future points of departure and arrival, helping them to create meaning and understanding of themselves and their (at times unsettling) professional learning pathways. From the ensuing thematic analyses, we identified a commonality of themes across life phases with three key influential groups of people (parents, peers, and professionals) that strongly affected their professional learning pathways and learner identity- construction. The results indicate that the relationships between these phases and people are complex. The research illuminates the previously unexplored connection between the meaning-making trajectories that are instantiated through critical reflection, and adds to our understanding of the development of musicians\\u2019 professional learning pathways and learner identities.

Large numbers of postgraduate musicians return to university settings to complete Higher Music Education courses to acquire new skills. Professional learning opportunities, as exemplified for postgradu- ate musicians, involve some of the most complex and fast-moving work contexts in existence (e.g., Burnard, 2019). The professional learning pathways and learner identities of musicians are understood as dialectical, dynamic, and fluid (Lawson, 2014; Turner & Tobbell, 2017); as living phenomena maximizing the impact of chances and choices during the process of finding or creating new music careers (see recent report in the United Kingdom by Bloom, 2020). In a study of identity and its relationship to cultivating a music career, Hracs (2010) found that self- reflexivity is increasingly important to the ways in which professionals engage, seize opportuni- ties, and manage risk across their practices. Fostering the development of professional learning pathways for postgraduate musicians involves adapting and developing innovations that they perceive to be pragmatically valuable; however, trying their best to dutifully learn from critical reflection practices in their professional life may not align with or be supported by significant changes in the professional learning pathways of the careers of postgraduate musicians. Determining what really matters to how musicians\\u2019 professional learning pathways are evi- denced in career decisions is problematic at best, and is also rapidly shifting given the current global pandemic. In this study, we define professional learning pathways (expanding the concept of \\u201clearning pathways\\u201d previously studied in musical improvisation by Despr\\u00e9s et al., 2016, to professional studies) as the constructed route that learners build through and outside their training programs to discover new ideas, pursue their interests, and develop their skills\\u2014 trajectories that are necessarily relational and contextually constituted (e.g., Moran & John-\"}, {\"page\": 3, \"text\": \"How do they transfer these lessons to inform changes to their professional learning pathways?\\nBennett, 2020).\"}, {\"page\": 4, \"text\": \"Critical incidents and learner identity in professional learning\\nIn this article, we follow Falsafi and Coll (2015) in the field of Constructivist Psychology of\"}, {\"page\": 5, \"text\": \"Turning points in various phases of postgraduate musicians\\u2019 careers\\nPurpose of the study\\nMethod\\nDesign\"}, {\"page\": 6, \"text\": \"132 Research Studies in Music Education 44(1)\\nTable 1.

For participants who were able to identify songs from commercial recordings in this experiment, general long-term involvement with activities believed to increase awareness of harmony, such as playing a harmonic instrument, playing chords by ear, and transcribing harmonic progressions was often not enough to enable them to identify songs from their chord progressions alone.\\nAdditionally, the ability to identify songs from chord progressions was most strongly correlated with having played and being able to write out the chord labels of the target pieces from long-term memory.

With hybridity, I mean bringing together people who otherwise would not be in contact with each other, and being open to their stories, situations and conceptions of art (see Bhabha, 1994). To this ephemeral community, I invite people from different social backgrounds to collectively create a joint piece of art, most often a performance with documentary traits. In the hybrid community of artistic expression, the very basic theatrical exercise is about how to take the other person\\u2019s position. It can be described as an identity game of imagining what it is like for me to be you (Goldman 2012).\\nForming a hybrid community of artistic expression can be seen as a method of making a documentary theatre performance with a special emphasis on the notion of community. It illuminates the situations of differently marginalized people and makes them more understandable and visible to others within the broader society. This way, putting oneself in the position of others could also be regarded as an act of civic awareness. It is an artistic and social experiment of living with the politics of difference, as sociologist Stuart Hall (1987) might put it.\\nOther home as a hybrid community of artistic expression\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"society, where community is replaced by the structures of a society and based on agreements. In theatre we, however, tend to highly value the idea, or the ideal, of a community.\\nFor me, the basic elements of a community that appeared in the Other home project can be illuminated with the help of four classical sociological concepts. 1) Communitas. Other Home had elements of something that the anthropologist Victor Turner (1995) calls communitas. This is a special sense of equality between subjects of a ritual. Communitas is existential and anti-structural by its very nature and functions as a counterforce to the hierarchical side of the society. It represents the power of the oppressed, in this case the voices of the people with a refugee background. In Other home, the ultimate expression of structure was in texts from the Finnish Immigration Service, which also formed a part of the dramatic plot of the performance. 2) Liminality. Referring to Arnold Van Gennep, Victor Turner (1995) also talks about liminality, which can be described as a basic characteristic for a person or a community in transition. The status of an asylum seeker or a refugee is liminal: non-belonging to the country of origin anymore and non-belonging to the present society yet (Butler & Spivak, 2007). Artists are, according to Turner, in a constant state of liminality as they work as agents for a change. In this way, many members of the Other home community had a double liminal identity: as refugees and as artists. 3) Stigma. Another sociological concept that was crucial to the community of Other home is Erving Goffmann\\u2019s stigma (1986). It is a trait in a person or a group of individuals that can be conceived as inferior or \\u201cspoiling the identity\\u201d in the eyes of the wider society. Belonging in a minority ethnic group or being a refugee is typically a stigma. In the Other home community, the aim was to show everybody on the stage as full identities and empower them by giving them a chance to talk for themselves. 4) Imagined community.\"}, {\"page\": 3, \"text\": \"Politics here and back there\"}, {\"page\": 4, \"text\": \"The second time tensions emerged was when Iraqi Kurds declared independence in autumn 2017.\\nOur work day began with heated commentaries and tears, for reasons I didn\\u2019t understand at first.\"}, {\"page\": 5, \"text\": \"Other home as documentary theatre\\nReferences:\\nAnderson, B. 2006.

Intersemiotic translation in theatre refers to the fleshing out of the script, the bringing together of the actor\\u2019s body and the script, stage, lighting, music, costume, makeup and special effects. In this article, a foreign accent is regarded as deriving from intersemiotic translation. Research into intersemiotic translation in theatre has produced mainly case studies (e.g. Aal- tonen 2007, 2010), whereas theatre studies have largely focused on the type of relationship between the text and performance (e.g. Carlson 1985; Vanden Heu- vel 1993), or staged performance as a process (Chauduri 1999). Research into intersemiotic translation is complicated by the fact that staged performances are events of the past and, therefore, not directly accessible to researchers. Instead, as Thomas Postlewait (1991: 158) has pointed out, they have to rely on second- ary evidence from often random documentation. According to him, documents, then, are also products of their time, drawing upon presuppositions of complex theoretical ideas such as cultural ideologies, narrative paradigms and principles of causality or contiguity. In addition, even if researchers could gain access to the script, both audible and visible signs suggested in them may have been changed or ignored in the actual mise en sc\\u00e8ne, or there might be no guidelines at all. Everything on stage can carry a semantic meaning. Visible signs, such as costume, makeup, furniture, and lighting, can be read as part of the story and so can audible signs of music, noises, silence, the actor\\u2019s voice quality and/or accent. The decision on the use of a particular language or language variety (dialect, accent, style, or register) may have been taken a priori by the play- wright or director/translator, and all characters may use it. A language variety may have been employed in the text to promote an ideological agenda and to support the rights of those who use it. It may also be used in the text to imply a characterological or locational feature such as in the play Masj\\u00e4vlar (2001) when the Swedish playwright Maria Blom set her play in Dalarna, a county north of Stockholm.

Collectively, these cultural resources are managed to build the image or identity of a place \\u2013 city or region \\u2013 in a positive way, which confers what is commonly described as reputation (Bell, 2016). For example, \\u201cNordicness\\u201d, as a place brand, is unique in that its reputation is not con\\ufb01ned to a region, but is rather an idea that transverses geographical bounds (Cassinger et al., 2018; Pietil\\u00e4 et al., 2019). At the heart of this \\u201creputational capital\\u201d (Bell, 2016), symbolic resources function as conduits for place branding discourses and expressions of discursive meanings (Kaneva, 2011; Varga, 2013). Cassinger et al. (2016, p. 181) argue that the meaning-making process connected to nation branding resources (ideas, practices or con\\ufb01gurations) is dynamic, that is contextually, temporally and spatially bound. While foregrounding the role of institutional actors, they maintain that this process requires consensus, mutual understanding and \\u201csupport from the population\\u201d. The meaning of place branding and regionalisation discourse depends, therefore, not only on the institutional context but also on the citizen participants who shape and reiterate what is legitimate or \\u201cdesirable, proper, or appropriate\\u201d (Suchman, 1995, p. 574). The purpose of this study is to explore institutional legitimation processes in the production of Finnish national identity through place branding discourses. The institutional legitimacy of a place branding discourse is an ongoing set of individual and social processes established in an apparent collective acceptance by local community members as desirable or suitable (Brown and Toyoki, 2013; Suchman, 1995). Substantial research has been devoted to understanding the external legitimacy of place brands; this includes the ecology or environments that place brands exist, their envelopment in neoliberal discourses (Lucarelli, 2018; Varga, 2013), as well as the various stakeholders involved, including government regulators, foreign diplomacy makers, marketers, tourists, transnational corporations, product brands and employees (Cassinger et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2003). Far less attention has been paid to internal legitimacy, afforded by a nation\\u2019s inhabitants or residents (Braun et al., 2013; Lichrou et al., 2017; Warnaby and Medway, 2013), and its import for the stability and institutionalisation of place branding discourses. The relevance of this, we suggest, sits in uncovering how place branding discourses may function as a form of internal legitimation for national identity among internal stakeholders who, until now, have been underexamined; and how this discursive work unfolds around symbolic resources, co-constituting place brands through bottom-up processes of legitimation work. Building on previous research adopting a cultural approach (Bianchini and Ghilardi, 2007), place branding is understood as a dynamic communication process whereby the institutional legitimation of national identity can be seen as a policy instrument (Lucarelli and Giovanardi, 2014). Understanding legitimation work as a malleable discursive resource embedded in a dynamic interplay of consensus and contestation, \\u201ctalked and written continuously into and out of existence\\u201d through place branding discursive work (Brown and Toyoki, 2013, p. 867), becomes relevant as language is a signi\\ufb01cant \\u201cmedium of social control and power\\u201d that represents modes of brand governance (Fairclough, 1989, p. 3). As place-branding studies have generally prioritised external stakeholders (Warnaby and Medway, 2013), far less attention has been paid to local voices and how they sustain and repudiate \\u201cexisting social and power relations\\u201d through processes of governance (Fairclough, 1995, p. 77). Based on an in-depth case study of sauna in Finland, we attend to these underexamined internal stakeholders, analysing how inhabitants\\u2019 talk functions as internal legitimacy work.\"}, {\"page\": 3, \"text\": \"The role of legitimacy in the context of place branding\"}, {\"page\": 5, \"text\": \"Pseudonym Gender Age Participant role\\nAleksi Male 49 President of a sauna association\\nAnna Female 28 Filmmaker and sauna enthusiast\\nAntti Male 35 Public sauna owner\\nEmma Female 37 Director of a Finnish sauna club\\nHeidi Female 31 Casual sauna user\\nHenri Male 45 Journalist\\nJoel Male 29 Photographer and sauna enthusiast\\nLauri Male 55 Public sauna owner\\nLeevi Male 51 Vice President of a Finnish sauna club\\nMaria Female 43 Sauna enthusiast\\nRisto Male 40 Casual sauna user Table 1.\\nSten Male 66 Public sauna owner Participant\\nTanya Female 30 Sauna enthusiast characteristics\"}, {\"page\": 15, \"text\": \"Scott, W.R.

I argue that in House of Cards, spheres of influence are related to a militarised form of masculinity in which violent solutions are preferred and celebrated. I focus on season 3 which introduced spheres of influence in the form a US\\u2013Russia rivalry in the Middle East.

E-mail: jukka.laitinen@laurea.fi Abstract: Combining a foresight system and an innovation system at the regional level is a challenging task when considering SMEs\\u2019 needs. The national innovation systems and foresight practices are running well among large corporations. However, SMEs\\u2019 needs and skills are different from the institutional purposes of these systems. SMEs\\u2019 challenges for the future success are mostly related to their position in the value chain / network as well as to the limited resources for the strategic work and development activities. Also, SMEs\\u2019 role in the local community is often important as an employer and as a voice of entrepreneurs to the municipalities. Therefore, the renewal of SMEs is not only important to the companies themselves, but also for the region. The regional forums for innovation and foresight have to be developed from the perspective of SMEs, supporting their renewal and ability to grow and follow trends and signals of the future.

Low-educated workers tend to leave the labour market earlier than the high-edu- cated, which creates educational inequalities in the employment rates of older workers. Yet relatively little is known about how large these inequalities are and how they have developed across time. If the employment rates of older workers are rising but educational inequalities remain stable or increase, policymakers may need to reconsider ways of making the extension of working lives more inclusive. Studying educational inequalities in the employment of older workers across time is com- plicated by the fact that the educational structure of the population continues to change. Cohorts that now approach the retirement age have a considerably higher education than cohorts that retired fifteen years ago. This educational expansion has had a positive effect on extending working lives [1]. However, while it is possible that the overall inequalities between older workers in society have declined because the share of high-educated people has increased, the relative disadvantages for the low-educated groups may have remained the same or even grown in younger cohorts. Finland makes an interesting case for studying educational inequalities in employment for several reasons. While the employment rate in the age group 55\\u201364 years was only around 35 percent in the mid-1990s, it has increased to more than 60 percent in recent years. A series of pension reforms during this period explicitly aimed at extending working lives and increasing the employment of older workers. At the same time, over the past decades, the share of people who have completed tertiary education has risen drastically in this age group while the share of those with low qualifications continues to decline (see S1 Table in S1 File). Currently, Finland is one of the countries in Europe with the most highly educated older workforce. However, at the present, there is no information on whether the rise in the employment rate has occurred in all pre- or post-retirement-age groups and on all educational levels. Finland could forebode of how the educational inequalities in employment of older people will develop in other countries. This study explores employment of 60\\u201368-year-old men and women by educational level over the period 2006\\u20132018 and the magnitude of educational inequalities in employment. We propose a novel method to analyse both absolute and relative educational inequalities in employment. Using exceptional register data for the entire Finnish population allows us to observe employment rates in smaller-than-usual age brackets and to disaggregate these by gen- der and level of education. We analyse employment levels and educational inequalities among three age groups: 1) those that are approaching their retirement age (60\\u201362 years), 2) those that are eligible for an old-age pension but have incentives and often good opportunities to continue working (63\\u201365 years), and 3) those that possibly face increasing obstacles and disin- centives to continue working (66\\u201368 years). We observe trends in employment and educa- tional inequalities in these age groups between 2006 and 2018. This article is organised as follows. The following section introduces previous literature on educational inequalities in employment at older age and describes changes in the incentives for employment at older age in the Finnish pension system. Section 3 describes the data and methods. Section 4 presents our findings, which are discussed further in section 5. Background Educational inequalities in employment at older age Studies have identified numerous mechanisms behind the early exit and lower employment rates of low-educated older workers. First, a lower socioeconomic status is associated with poorer health, which may limit possibilities to continue work [17\\u201325].

Outshoot of this interest are entrepreneurship programs, which train and fund nascent entrepreneurs with university background. These programs utilize a plethora of well studied innovation and entrepreneurship tools. What is not well understood, however, is how we should factor in the unique motivations and needs of the entrepreneurs themselves. The current entrepreneurial motivation research has the problem of being too abstract to be practically useful for program managers. In this paper, we hope to find a new research methodology and as a result claim to have found one in object-process methodogy (OPM). We demonstrate the applicability of the methodology by using it to model a Finnish university-funded micro-funding program targeting students and researchers with new innovative business ideas. Key Words entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship programs, object-process methodology, entrepreneurial motivation JEL Classification: C21, R13 Introduction\\nThere exists a lot of research about and methods for nascent entrepreneurs andorganizations involved in the process of developing new business opportunities. Bulk ofthese methods have focused on the questions of business viability and uncertaintyreduction. Methods like the discovery-driven planning by McGrath and MacMillan (1995),the lean startup by Eric Ries (2011), the DEFT by Innosight\\u2019s Scott Anthony (2014) arefocused on testing and validating business ideas efficiently. Business model canvasgeneration by Alexander Osterwalder (2008) is a widely popular tool in entrepreneurprograms worldwide with a focus on modelling and innovating at the level of the wholebusiness model. More approaches include Outcome-Driven Innovation by Strategyn\\u2019sAnthony Ullwick (2005) and the Jobs-to-be-Done theory by Clayton Christensen et al.(2016), which focus on recognizing and understating the customer needs deeply beforeputting actual effort in developing and implementing any business ideas based on them.Another set of tools and thinking utilized in many programs is the design thinkingapproach made famous during the 90s by design company IDEO (Camacho, 2016). Likemore evolved versions of the same thinking, design thinking emphasizes understandingthe customer\\u2019s perspective by careful observation and interviews. Von Hippel\\u2019s lead-usertheory (1986) is based on the idea that knowledge of customer needs is best captured bycustomers themselves.
