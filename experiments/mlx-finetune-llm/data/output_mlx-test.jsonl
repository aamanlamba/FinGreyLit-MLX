This paper will give an overview of some of these sources and their varied but generally positive discussion on Nijinsky's work in order to argue that these informed Russian spectators perceived Sacre in a manner that contests how this work has been represented in dance history.

Writing after a World War, both also separated the work from the tradition of Russian art, specifically the neo-nationalist art that many Russian critics emphasised in their reviews. This downplaying of nationalism is the most significant change in representations of Sacre ever since, and relates to issues of authorship and modernism that I will address here. As in any large production, who originated which aspect of the end product is, frankly, not a very interesting research question. The process of collaboration can be fraught with conflicts and creative disagreements invisible in the end result, and Nijinsky's letter alludes to these with the conditional \\u201cif all will be the way you and I have wished it to be\\u201d. As Nijinsky appraises the rehearsals with the dancers are going well, this hints at some other discord in the collaboration or within the company.2 It is very tempting to read such conflict in terms of the modernist myth of the vanguard young creators separating their ties to academic conventions and the habitual spectator Nijinsky mentions. This view has dominated interpretations of Stravinsky's score, but not of Roerich's neo-nationalist sets and costumes, which lack the necessary signs of aesthetic break attributed to both the music and the choreography.

Roerich, however, had sent the designs to Stravinsky, with the result that on 20.12.1912/2.1.1913 (in Stravinsky 1997, i:398), Nijinsky\\u2019s partner, the impresario Diaghilev, was still asking Stravinsky for the set designs, as well as issuing the ultimatum that were the composer not to show up in the rehearsals as Nijinsky requested, Sacre would not be performed. The company r\\u00e9gisseur, Grigoriev gave the lack of costume designs as the excuse for not beginning the rehearsals in a letter to Stravinsky 5./18.12.1912 Stravinsky 1997, i:390; cf. Stravinsky-Craft 1978, 93. Diaghilev renewed his request 10./23.3.1913 (Stravinsky 1997, ii:42), which means Nijinsky still had not had the designs. In this letter, Diaghilev also told Stravinsky that the presence of Roerich was not required in the rehearsals, which may explain why Roerich was not credited with the mise-en-sc\\u00e8ne of Sacre, even though the libretto had been written by him in collaboration with Stravinsky.\"}]}\n    <|eot_id|>\n                                  <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"}

This paper is a review of optical methods for online nondestructive food quality monitoring. The key spectral areas are the visual and near-infrared wavelengths. We have collected the information of over 260 papers published mainly during the last 20 years. Many of them use an analysis method called chemometrics which is shortly described in the paper. The main goal of this paper is to provide a general view of work done according to different FAO food classes. Hopefully using optical VIS/NIR spectroscopy gives an idea of how to better meet market and consumer needs for high-quality food stuff. 1.

We have developed audio platform, two different workshops and engagement measurement instrument to sup- port these cultural institutes in organizing engaging extracurricular activities. Our platform consists of an audio digital asset management system (ADAM), a management applica- tion, and mobile applications. The mobile applications are audio story sharing and audio augmented reality, which enable creating and sharing digital stories and soundscapes. As our audio platform aims to reach and activate young people, it is necessary also to co-operate with and motivate schools and teachers. Thus, structured and tested workshops, which fulfil extracurricular characteristics, will serve this purpose. In our case, we have developed two different workshops, which have a clear structure; are supervised by adults, and have pedagogical objectives for the participants\\u2019 skill development. We have applied the student engagement structure by Fredricks, Blumenfeld and Paris in order to find out the level of engagement in workshops. By observing participants and utilizing a questionnaire, which we have developed, it is possible to measure the level of three engagement components.\\nWe have tested our audio platform, workshop concept, and engagement measurement instrument in four separate events in Finland and Poland. The results are promising. There is a versatile audio plat- form, which is affordable for cultural institutions, and there is a concept to reach young people and a measurement instrument to measure the level of engagement in a workshop context.

Several studies have linked these activities to positive psychological and academic outcomes [1]. Adolescents who participate in the extracurricular activities during high school have higher self-esteem and lower rates of depression. They have higher grades, test scores, school engagement and educational aspi- rations. Thus, schools are willingly co-operating with parties who can offer extracurricular activities. To this end, cultural institutions, like museums and art galleries organize extracurricular activities for youth. These extracurricular activities are one approach to attract more visitors. At the same time, they develop new activities, such as context-aware audio guides, augmented reality and 3D modelling based applications, and interactive digital storytelling [2, 3, 4] to provide interactive experiences for an audience familiar with of digital interaction.\"}]}\n    <|eot_id|>\n                                  <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"}

It likewise discusses the kind of site- specific choreographic process of opening up to what in everyday life is not apparent and left in the shadows that generated the writing. The objective of the choreographic process was to allow the impact of the bodily sense of being in contact with an urban location to permeate the authors\\u2019 activities in writing. To support this intention, they generated a phenomenologically informed performative score of experimental writing that aims at appreciating the vitality of the sensuous. The first part of the submission presents the actual choreographic writing as an evocative piece of choreography that can be read independently of the second part. This latter part contains an exploration into conceptions about choreography and writing. Here the article draws specifically on Jean-Luc Nancy\\u2019s insights to articulate the kind of phenomenological approach the authors engaged in. It aims at establishing their artistic process as a phenomenologically oriented method in expanded choreography and argues that the writing they generated exscribes their encounter with the Hakaniemi bank in Helsinki on a late December day. It likewise details the significance the body bears on their take on choreographic writing and points towards the manner in which this writing contains traces of the inexpressible and non-thinkable.

A junkie stooping on the shoreline, freezing by the muddy water. Aversive melancholy. Will anybody be saved? One pitiful boat returning from sea. The Hakaniemi bank, do not fall under. An edge, a square, a rigorously structured islet almost forgotten, circumscribed by streets, alleys, bridges and the see. The hubbub of roaring cars.

After entering the impressive Entrance Hall, we were shown to the large and beautiful garden situated behind the palace. When every delegate had a glass in their hand, Monica Wechsler from the University of Basel Medical Library and member of the Local Organizing Committee, greeted us all welcome. Her multitalented and musical colleague Christoph Wehrm\\u00fcller (LOC Co-chair) then entered the stage together with Teresa Lee (Chair of the International Programme Committee). Christoph stated that \\u201clibrarians are versatile\\u201d which he and Teresa very much proved when they surprised us all by performing a string duet, composed by the Ger- man composer Telemann. The piece was very enjoyable and the music fitted very well to the baroque style surrounding. The Welcome Reception was a great opportunity to meet new EAHIL friends and to network.

Taxon: Parus major, Cyanistes caeruleus. Methods: We recorded clutch coverage estimates and collected egg covering nest material from the tit nests. We also measured nest specific breeding parameters and phenotypic measurements on adults. We tested whether mean spring temperatures, nest predation rates and flycatcher (Ficedula spp) densities in the study areas explain the large-scale geographical variation of clutch coverage and reproductive success of tits. Results: The degree of egg coverage of great tits increased with lower mean spring temperature, higher nest predation rate and higher flycatcher density. We did not find egg covering of blue tits to be associated with any of the ecological or abiotic factors. Moreover, egg covering of great tits was not associated with reproductive success in our cross-sectional data, yet a rigorous assessment of fitness effects would require long-term data. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that, in great tits, egg covering may simul- taneously provide thermal insulation against cold temperatures during egg-laying in spring and also represent a counter-adaptation to reduce information parasitism by flycatchers and nest predation. Hence, geographical variation in interspecific interac- tions, and consequently in co-evolutionary processes, may affect the evolution of nest characteristics besides environmental conditions.

Alesja Serada School of Marketing and Communication, University of Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland, aserada@uwasa.fi ABSTRACT CryptoKitties (Axiom Zen 2017) is a pioneering blockchain-based game that disrupts the \\u2018classic game model\\u2019 (Juul 2003; 2013) in a way that turns it into a gambling web application. As previous research has shown, its mechanics are almost exclusively based on chance (Scholten et al 2019), and the rest is mostly speculation with game assets (Lee, Yoo and Jang 2019). This raises the question whether this game requires any skill, such as strategic planning. In my case study, I revisit the game system and perform a practice of playing it to differentiate between unpredictable (or \\u201caleatory\\u201d, as in Johnson 2018) and decision-making points in the game. I argue that mapping the journey of a player should complement analysis of the game system to assess the balance between skill and chance in a better-informed manner. KEYWORDS Blockchain, online games, online gambling, Ethereum, video game ethics, game economies, open market. 1 \\u2018Crypto Games\\u2019 as the Latest Form of Gambling Gambling typically means wagering something of value on an event with an unpredictable outcome (Derevensky & Griffith 2019). Uncertainty of outcome has always been present in games (Costikyan 2013; Johnson 2018), which also means that playing games has always invited manifold forms of gambling and betting. Most lately, chance mechanics in digital games and betting practices around them have led to the \\u201cgamblification\\u201d of sports and competitive video games (Macey and Hamari 2018).\\nGambling has undergone several circles of marginalization and normalization in modernized societies (Caillois 1961). It is commonly agreed that \\\"luck is seen often as a central way to make games fair\\\" (Johnson 2018, 97). \\u2018Democratic\\u2019 games of chance provide equal opportunities to all participants, regardless of their skill and social status. Recent development of blockchain technologies and their application to games provide an opportunity to present game algorithms as transparent and even more \\u2018fair\\u2019 (Kraft 2019). However, such games are often criticized for lack of the actual gameplay and speculative tendencies (Lee, Yoo and Jang 2019), as well as for their close ties to gambling. In general, gambling can be detrimental to the wellbeing of players and to economies in general (Roger Caillois even labels it \\u201cthe cancer of economies\\u201d). One of the best known blockchain-based games bases on chance mechanics is CryptoKitties, a browser game on the Ethereum platform published by Axiom Zen in 2017 \\\\cite{chohan_leisures_2017}. Similar mechanics are present in many pet breeding simulators, such as Ovipets (IDZTECH 2011) and Dragon City (Social Point 2012), not to mention the Pokemon franchise. The principal difference is the fee paid to breed virtual pets (0.008ETH for the most time of the game\\u2019s existence). This fee is paid to execute a 'smart contract' that eventually leads to the birth of a new \\u2018kitty\\u2019 with a randomly assigned unique set of attributes, such as shape and color of its body parts. A combination of two attributes may result in a 'mutation', when a new attribute of a higher level presents itself: this may increase the 'kitty's' value. \\u2018Kitties\\u2019 are unique non-fungible Ethereum tokens kept in an Ethereum wallet (usually Metamask or the company\\u2019s own wallet Dapper).\"}]}\n    <|eot_id|>\n                                  <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"}
