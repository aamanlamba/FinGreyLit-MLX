The materiality of costumes \\u2013 the fabric, cut, and dye \\u2013 organised the dancing bodies on stage in a manner that, in part, relied on Russian contexts invisible to the predominantly foreign audiences of the performances in Paris and London. Subsequently, these Russian reactions where The Rite of Spring was part of a continuum of representations of Russia\\u2019s past have been largely ignored in favour of the opinions of French and British critics, for whom the work appeared extraordinary and alien. The so-called reconstruction (1987), where the surviving costumes were used to compensate for the absence of choreographic understanding, has further obscured what the choreography was and what costumes actually did (and do) in performance. Although decisions made in recreating performance differ from historiographical research, exploring the practical making of costumes also draws attention to perspectives often forgotten in discussions of past performance more generally \\u2013 such as changes in how costumes are experienced, or what that experience explains of later reminiscences. Introduction: An Authentic Past?\\nFew theatrical spectacles have acquired a canonical position in several art forms, but The Rite of Spring, which premiered on 29 May 1913 at the new Th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es in Paris, is certainly one. The surviving costumes from this production, notably those in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum (henceforth V&A), offer a tantalising opportunity to examine a broad selection of dance costumes from a famous production that are in remarkably good shape for their age.1 Studied in the context of other surviving materials, they illustrate how the established practices and principles of the company, the Ballets Russes, continued from one production to the next: how aspects such as fabric, pattern, or methods of ornamentation were neither unique to The Rite of Spring nor fundamentally searching for ethnographic accuracy or historic \\u2018authenticity\\u2019. However, this critical approach requires contextualisation of the artwork as not singular and unique but existing in relation to local traditions and established practices of the art form. Understanding different types of materials further necessitates using methods from costume research, dance and performance scholarship and practice-led research as well as cultural and art history. As I have previously argued (J\\u00e4rvinen 2020a), in terms of scenography, focus on either one of the librettists, the composer Igor Stravinsky or the designer Nikolai Roerich, has obscured how, for Russian audiences at least, The Rite of Spring continued established ideas of staging 1 Although referenced individually in the notes, please follow the link at the beginning of the References section to the online site where I have gathered links to images of these non-textual materials. 1\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"the national past. Although purportedly about pagan Russians ensuring the return of spring, the two-act ballet where not a single character had a name or appeared in both acts, sharply divided critical opinion. In Russia, it was seen as a welcome change in the repertory of the Ballets Russes, and even in the \\u2018new ballet\\u2019 \\u2013 a trend in Russian ballet that had emphasised scenography, acting, and movements of the whole body. Paradoxically, the Russian critical acclaim for a work that previously well-disposed foreign critics found distressing was awkward for the impresario of the troupe, Sergei Diaghilev, and those of his coterie (like Stravinsky) who had built their international reputations as \\u2018artistic revolutionaries\\u2019, not understood in their home country. (Taruskin 1996, 978\\u2013988; J\\u00e4rvinen 2014, 202\\u2013224) Even today, productions by the Ballets Russes are regularly severed from their native contexts, and none more often than The Rite of Spring. The sole contemporaneous opinions heard are those of French and British critics who, at best, did not understand these works in the continuum of theatrical arts in Russia nor in the context of dance as an art form. At worst, what gets cited as \\u2018insightful\\u2019 rests on prejudice or outright racism, as in the case of Jacques Rivi\\u00e8re, whose two-part article (J.R. 1913; Rivi\\u00e8re 1913) has been frequently cited as the most brilliant analysis of Nijinsky\\u2019s choreography for The Rite of Spring. (See J\\u00e4rvinen 2013a, 9n35) To use Edward Sa\\u00efd\\u2019s (1994) terminology, The Rite of Spring and the company that created it have been subjected to the Orientalising gaze of the Occidental expert that silences contemporary Russian critical opinion on this company.\\nToday, critical understanding of The Rite of Spring is complicated by the presence, in ballet company repertories, of the so-called reconstruction, created in 1987 by Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer. (See Calozzi, 2009; Wikipedia 2020) Marketed as \\u2018Nijinsky\\u2019s choreography\\u2019 and accompanied by prolific publications, this work has attained a hegemonic status and its authors regarded as experts even though scholarly understanding of reconstruction and re-enactment practices in the performing arts has drastically changed in the past three decades. Hodson and Archer have claimed a particularly focal role in the 1913 production for the designer Roerich: Archer is an art historian specialising on Roerich, and Hodson (1985a; 1986\\u20131987) has insisted that Nijinsky used the designs, costumes, and Roerich\\u2019s advice in creating the choreography. Taken together with the notes of Nijinsky\\u2019s assistant, Marie Rambert (n.d.) translated by Rambert in 1967, and Stravinsky\\u2019s similarly translated (1969) annotations, as well as French and British reviews (largely from Bullard 1971), Hodson has claimed herself an alter ego of Nijinsky, when in fact her interpretations reproduce the aforementioned Orientalist bias. Moreover, nothing in the historical record testifies against the reconstructors\\u2019 professed 'fidelity\\u2019 to the 1913 production as strongly as the concrete materiality of the surviving costumes.

This motivates firms to adopt new strategies based on digital technologies; such new strategies are often referred to as digital transformation strategies (DTSs). Unlike with firms that were founded with a basis in digital, the implementation of a DTS at a traditional company can lead to entire changes in organizational structure, culture, and processes; how such changes happen remains an open question. As a result, this study examines how such changes were made during the process of implementing a DTS at a global Finland-based energy company. An interpretive case study employing different data sources is used. We contribute to the research by identifying changing patterns and key features in three phases of the process of implementing a DTS. In particular, the general pattern of this process is continuous incremental change; however, each phase of the process has different features, models and directions. Keywords: interpretive case study, digital strategy, digital transformation, organizational change, digital transformation strategy Introduction\\nRapid digitalization and technological change have been disrupting traditionally successful business models in recent years (Nanterme 2016; Vayghan 2018; Vial 2019). This motivates firms to adopt and implement new strategies based on digital technologies. By doing so, firms can transform their business model, including services, operations, and products (Berente and Yoo 2012; Bharadwaj et al. 2013; Chanias et al. 2018; Ross et al. 2016). Such new strategies are often referred to as digital transformation strategies (DTSs); digital technologies refer to technologies related to cloud computing (Du et al. 2016), mobile devices (Pousttchi et al. 2015), social media (Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2013), analytics (G\\u00fcnther et al. 2017), the Internet (Ross et al. 2016), the Internet of things (IoT) (Petrikina et al. 2017), platforms (Tan et al. 2015), software (Setia et al. 2013) and blockchain (Glaser 2017). However, it is argued that established companies (e.g., Volvo, ABB and Phillips) may require different DTSs compared with companies rooted in digital technology (e.g., Google, Facebook and Twenty-Third Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems, Dubai, UAE, 2020 1\"}]}"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "{\"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"Changing patterns in the process of digital transformation initiative in established firms : the case of an energy sector company\", \"creator\": [\"Dang, Duong\", \"Vartiainen, Tero\"], \"year\": \"2020\", \"publisher\": [\"Association for Information Systems (AIS)\"], \"type_coar\": \"conference paper\"}"}]}

In this study, the service design approach was used to enhance companies' innovation capabilities within the cultural and tourism sector in the South Karelia and Uusimaa region in Finland and St. Petersburg area in Russia. Idea generation sessions were set up with the Bachelor students of LAB University of Applied Sciences to provide fresh ideas for the participating companies. As the student innovation suggestions were a preliminary stage in the process, outside experts were later involved to further facilitate idea generation modules. The companies were introduced to the service design methods and were offered online 1-on-1 mentoring sessions with the project experts. The assumption was that the companies faced with the Covid19 crisis would generate and adapt radical innovations. However, the study found that innovations, in general, were incremental rather than revolutionary and were centred around customer satisfaction and the customer path. Using online working sessions to apply service design as a problem-solving tool was also a new approach to the participants. The operational side of the company rather than the radical innovation aspect emerged as the most viable path for the companies to pursue their business activities due to their current lack of human and financial resources.

This type of learning is considered effective for adult learning because it involves active experimentation, building on existing knowledge and comparing it with new experiences. Experiential learning is widely used in entrepreneurship education and in professional training programmes as it enables the learning outcomes defined by the European Commission [3] as \\\"converting an idea into reality\\\" or, more specifically, as defined by Hytti and O'Gorman [4], starting own business. The methods of experiential learning widely adopted in adult education include problem-based learning, cooperative learning, and simulations. Problem-based learning (PBL) involves creating a real-world case challenge and placing students in action to solve the problem using their knowledge acquired during the course [5; 6; 7]. The essence of cooperative learning is in developing a learning environment facilitating the exchange of experiences and perspectives between the learners [8]. This learning method is specifically relevant for online learning adult education, where experienced participants value possibilities of discussion and interaction [9; 10]. Simulations involve developing scenarios with a wide range of alternatives [11] that allow mimicking real-world situations. The experiential learning practices are often associated with group work and creating learning communities.\"}]}"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "{\"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"Service design experimental learing in adult education\", \"creator\": [\"Bogdanova, Olga\", \"Brusila-Meltovaara, Kristiina\", \"Iso-Aho, Juha\", \"Vuorela, Taina\"], \"year\": \"2021\", \"doi\": \"10.21125/iceri.2021.0402\", \"e-isbn\": [\"9788409345496\"], \"type_coar\": \"conference paper\"}"}]}

Through a series of examples, the article attempts at showing that research in and through the arts raises the stakes of epistemic presentation because it thematises the mode of presentation as part of the subject matter. This calls for media sensitivity and new conceptual models for epistemic operations. Some of the challenges at the core of artistic research are highlighted with regard to models of \\u201caesthetic research\\u201d and \\u201cexpositionality\\u201d. Finally, the article addresses the tensional interplay of aesthetic and epistemic research processes and proposes a diplomatic approach in the spirit of Isabelle Stengers\\u2019 \\u201cecology of practices\\u201d, which the article presents as an incentive to giving more weight to radical situatedness of epistemic practices.

He first states the importance of audiovisual archives for various areas of research and highlights then a problem related with recent media technological developments that are contrib- uting to the emergence of \\u201cnew material supports of knowledge\\u201d. Even if science is essentially \\u201ca modality of transmission of knowledge\\u201d there are various academic, legal and commercial restrictions that significantly complicate the transmission of knowledge embedded in new media structures. The integration of media specific articulations, such as images, in research publications is highly regulated, at the same time as the medial embeddedness of knowledge shows an increasing cultural impact and should become more acknowledged in academic publishing practices as well1. In his improvised response to this issue, Derrida focuses on the question on whether and how images can play an argumentative role in academic discourse. He tells an anec- dote from one of his seminars in California. Two of his students had asked him, whether it would be possible to submit a video instead of a written essay in order to accomplish the seminar.

Derrida did not refuse the image just because it was an image and not a written academic text, but because the image had rather clumsily taken the place of what he thought \\u201ccould have and should have been elaborated more precisely with discourse or writing\\u201d3. The problem was that the video images didn\\u2019t manage to fulfil their argu- mentative role, they just appeared in place of discourse without adequately replacing it. During the course of their discussion, Stiegler and Derrida agree on the point that there doesn\\u2019t yet exist a \\u201cscholarly (if not scientific) practice of the image\\u201d but that in- tegration of images in research publications should, however, be encouraged \\u201cprovided that rigor, differentiation, refinement do not suffer as a result\\u201d4. Derrida sees that a new kind of research practice in medias res would be welcome and might actually emerge in wake of the quick technological developments in the areas of archiving and publishing. \\u201cThere will come a time when, in effect, one will be able to and will have to integrate images into the presentation of knowledge. I don\\u2019t know to what point this is impossible today, but in any case, it is still very limited\\u201d5. Of course, while this was certainly true for philosophical discourse in the 1990s, Stiegler and Derrida seem to neglect the fact that in some areas of research, such as cultural anthropology, images had made their way into research publications already decades earlier. Now, some twenty-five years later, we are in the situation where the epistemic op- erations involving images are not only much more widespread in various research con- texts, but also increasingly embedded in computational networks6. The Open Science movement, with its policies for open data management and dissemination guidelines, is gaining more and more weight in the international research landscape, which reduces the formative power of various access barriers and, in the best case, enables multifaceted approaches to medially embedded information and knowledge. Despite of the still he- gemonic position of the written academic text, research publishing standards are starting to embrace multimodal formats, enhanced texts and rich media presentations in many areas of research7. The buzzword \\u2018digital humanities\\u2019 signals a new orientation even in the traditionally very text-based humanities. Some of the proponents of this emerging research area argue that media literacy, that is, the capability for articulating passages from images and other media to text, is not enough for a humanities scholar today, a variety of digital methods and programming skills are needed as well. David Berry, the editor of Understanding Digital Humanities (2012), argues for \\u2018iteracy\\u2019, an iterative research practice that involves reflection on \\u201cwhat reading and writing actually should mean in a computational age\\u201d8. 2 Ibid., 142-143. 3 Ibid., 143. 4 Ibid., 143. 5 Ibid., 142. 6 These networks tend even to bypass the human viewer, which complicates the epistemic status of images beyond the scope of this article.

Introduction Concrete is a popular building material in the coastal region, as evidenced by the large number of coastal buildings, or structures on or near the coast. The development and utilization of coastal regions has increased significantly in recent decades, allowing for an increase in economic activity and employment opportunities, which leads to an increase in the human population along the coastal regions. According to the United Nations, approximately 40% of the world\\u2019s population lived within 100 km of the coast in 2017 [1]. This figure is expected to rise as the trend of population growth and migration from inland to coastal areas continues, increasing the demand for residential and office buildings in the coastal region. Concrete will continue to be used in coastal construction because it is abundant, resilient, durable, and affordable, and it can be used in an infinite number of ways. Although concrete is a durable building material, coastal buildings or even non-coastal buildings subjected to deicing salts, such as parking lots, can suffer from chloride attack. In coastal areas, marine aerosol, produced by the rupture of small bubbles on the sea surface and carried far inland by the wind, is the main source of chloride, which attacks the concrete structure [2]. Deicing salts, which are used to melt ice on roads during the winter, are a source of chloride that attacks concrete in non-coastal areas.

Unfortunately, the future does not have much room for fossil fuels, the era of renewable energy sources is here and will continue to grow. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) renewable energy currently accounts for one third of the global power capacity and the share will grow to about 50% by 2050. As the saying claims, desperate moments call for desperate measures and we are heading towards that. We cannot change the intermittent nature of these major energy sources, but we can learn to understand them and plan our new energy systems in such a way that they function as reliably as the conventional energy systems we are accustomed to. The key factor here is security of supply which comes with energy storage, store the energy during excess production and discharge when there is low or no production.

The practice of expositio is the foundational zoopolitical human gesture. It consisted of leaving new-born children exposed at street markets to be sold as slaves, or in nature, left to survive (or die). The spectres of those body-minds still haunt our onto-epistemologies: by creatively fabulating with Ludue\\u00f1a\\u2019s work, I suggest looking back to the broken chains of the production of able bodies instead of perpetuating the reproductive futurity. Ludue\\u00f1a\\u2019s work investigates how and why the figure of the spectre gradually disappeared from the discursive milieu, and why it needs to be brought back into the spotlight. Its potential resides in its existence between binary categories like God and human, man and animal, male and female. It queers, defying epistemological boundaries, what it means to be dead or alive. Melanie Yergeau employs the term \\u201cneuroqueer\\u201d to talk about the non-neurotypical and queer subjectivities that are a continuum of indiscernibility and are violently dislodged into binary categories. In the conclusion, I argue for operationalising the concept of the spectre to help to short-circuit the able- neurotypical and heteronormative futurism, looking back to the ghosts of the exposed children. Keywords: Fabian Ludue\\u00f1a, (neuro)queerness, spectrality In memory of my two dead brothers, who did not survive delivery, and Ioan Petro Culianu, shot to death in the divinity school of The University of Chicago, three spectres that instigated this writing. They all died in the spring of 1991.\\nIn this article, I first do a short literature review of the current approaches to spectrality in the scope of the deconstructionist and post-deconstructionist frameworks at the intersection of philosophy and its correlated fields. Later, I approach how the concept of the virtual is essential for an understanding of the not- yetness of spectrality. A letter from Hugo Boxel to Baruch Spinoza acts as the creative impetus that enables us to move forward with a discussion of Fabian Ludue\\u00f1a Romandini\\u2019s extensive take on the community of the spectres and its potential to undo binarism. Finally, I briefly discuss how this approach towards the figure of the ghost may be appropriate for discussing neuro(queer) body-minds and their deaths, which resist identification and the anthropocentric modalities of futurity. I talk about the practices of expositio in Ancient times as zoopolitical techniques, as Ludue\\u00f1a sets forth in his trilogy, a germ of a metaphysical dispositive that creates Man, read as the able neurotypical Western body that separates himself from nature. In a sense, this article is an invitation and a fabulatory queer reading of part of Ludue\\u00f1a\\u2019s work Article note: All citations of Luduena were translated by the article's author. *Corresponding author: Francisco Trento, CERADA, The Centre for Educational Research and Academic Development in the Arts.

Against the Anthropotechnical1 machine, I propose looking back to the ghosts of those who did not survive their expositio, as a gesture of queering the temporality, populating it with the failures of normalisation and looking towards other futures (or the lack of them). After the Trend: The Revenant Spectre The concept of spectrality gained recognition in the late 1990s after the publishing of Jacques Derrida\\u2019s Specters of Marx, and later by works of preeminent scholars like Maria del Pillar Blanco, Esther Peeren (2013) and Mark Fisher (2014). The scholarship on spectrality and its variations also appeared in the monster studies (Henriksen, 2016), approaches to weirdness, critiques of whiteness and Critical Disability Studies. Sandra Huber (17) fabulates that \\u201call academic ghost stories begin at Jacques Derrida\\u2019s 1993 Specters of\\nMarx and I\\u2019ll follow suit\\u201d. Like her, I will stick to this unavoidable thread. Derrida introduces the issue of spectrality while discussing William Shakespeare\\u2019s Hamlet, where \\u201cthe time is out of joint\\u201d, an affirmation of a temporal and ontological discomfort that cannot always be expressed in terms of language. \\u201cA disjointed or disadjusted now, a disjointed now that always risks maintaining nothing together\\u201d (Derrida 01). The source that emanates a disturbing spectral affect may be a traumatic event, individual or collective. Its traces resonate within the actual body, defying the traditional understandings of history and causality as being linear processes. Derrida once said that \\u201cthe media themselves (the news, the press, telecommunications, techno-tele-discursivity, techno-tele-iconicity)\\u201d are \\u201cneither dead, present nor absent: they spectralize\\u201d (Derrida 63), referring to the temporalities enacted by the media ecologies in development during the nineties. Derrida (03) points out that \\u201chaunting is historical, to be sure, but it is not dated, it is never docilely given a date in the chain of presents, day after day, according to the instituted order of a calendar\\u201d. A spectre, in Derridean terms, always emerges as a repetition, a \\u201crevenant, [that] day and night, tricks consciousness and skips generations, memories that do not longer recognise borders, they pass through walls\\u201d (Derrida 36, modified). The ghosts are never alone or constituted as a stable and individualised entity or chunk of affects.

Surviving and thriving in such an environment require cultural knowledge \\u2013 learning culture becomes inevitable. The value system is the basic building block of a culture. Culture is always a group property. Learning a new culture means learning the value system of that culture or of that group of people. Learning a new culture is not easy but not impossible either. One must engage with his/her entire body; head, hands and heart for internalising the value system of a new culture. In addition, willingness and drive to interact with people, nature and weather are crucial in the learning process along with speaking the language of the new culture. Author: Shaidul Kazi Learning a New culture \\u2013 A Crucial Measure for Adaptation Human beings\\u2019 inbuilt neural machinery drives them toward bonding with others. This bonding process instigates people to form groups. People form groups, among others, by binding together through links of family, friendship, work, style, sports teams, religion, and culture (Eagleman 2015, 163). A cultural link is a crucial background factor in forming groups. What is a culture? A culture is considered as something that is learned. It comprises norms and values and governs human behaviour to a particular-direction, does not change easily, which is characteristic of a particular-group, and is transmitted over time from one generation to the other (Kazi 2009, 97). The definition exposes that a culture is a learning outcome. Besides, culture is a group property. According to Kazi, values are the principal building block of a culture (Kazi 2009, 104). Social value and cultures are inseparable from each other.\\nConsequently, learning a new culture signifies learning the value system of that culture or about a group of people. Hatch (1997) states that values are the social principles, goals, and standards held within a culture to have intrinsic worth. They define what the members of an organization determine as important. They include freedom, democracy, tradition, wealth or loyalty. Values constitute the basis for making judgements about right and wrong, which is why they are also referred to as a moral or ethical code (Cited in Kazi 2009, 104\\u2013105). Values are emotionally charged priorities learned during the purely human process of socialization (Terpstra and David 1985, 117). Of our value systems, a significant portion is genetically determined. The rest is attributable to factors including national culture, parental dictates, teachers, and similar environmental influences (Robbins 1998, 133). Learning a new culture necessarily requires the understanding of its value system. Head, heart, and hand approach may assist in the process. A triangular psychological approach head, heart and hand which Cope (2003, 23) has used in consulting change management context may be appropriate in culture learning as well. This basic psychological approach may be suitable because a human being is a complex system involving the interaction of behaviours, emotions and thoughts. Compared to history, the world has never been so small and dynamic in terms of human and product mobility as it has been lately.

Although diffusion costs of renewable energy utilization are higher than fossil fuels and nuclear power plants, other policy aspects and operation costs of renewables cover this gap particularly in high dependent countries to fossil fuels. The current paper discusses the role of renewable portfolio in the Finland\\u2019s energy action plan during 2011\\u20132020. A system dynamics model is constructed to evaluate different costs of renewable energy utilization by 2020. Results show that total costs of new capacities of renewable energy systems as well as operation and maintenance costs of current systems bring 7% saving compared to total costs of new natural gas power plants (as a sample for second scenario) in Finland.

INTRODUCTION Energy security concerns along with consumption growth are rapidly rising in importance in almost all countries in particular high dependence countries to imported fossil fuels such as\\nFinland. In response, renewable energy resources (RER) are a solution to reduce dependency on imported energy and provide social and environmental bene\\ufb01ts. To decrease the dependency and improve security of energy supply, utilization of RER has been debated by Finnish govern- ments and policy makers. However, speed of new RE development plans particularly wind power has lagged that of other European countries in recent years in Finland. Compared to 27 European countries, Finland had almost low capacities of wind power (19/27), solar power (17/27), and solar heating (23/27) in 2010. To succeed diffusion programs of renewable energy(RE) development, different strategies such as technological improvements, increased economies of scale, and strong policy support should be contributed in both developed and developing countries.1 Nevertheless, compared to traditional energy sources, promotion of electricity/heat generated by RER is limited because of its relative investment high costs. This study compares the costs of RE development and fossil fuels according to the Finnish energy action plan for electricity/heat generation by 2020. Due to the complexity of such stud- ies, as well as different factors effects on costs analysis, the system dynamics approach is implemented to analyze the effectiveness of RE policies. The work is organized based on the following sections: Energy structure, supply, and con- sumption in Finland are reviewed in Sec. II. In Sec. III, the role of RE utilization in Finland is discussed. Indeed, important RERs and their potentials are also reviewed. Related polices and government\\u2019s schemes to RE utilization in Finland are described in Sec. IV.

This integrated literature review aimed to describe how ontological and contextual nursing competence becomes evident in evaluations done with it and the value of using it for professional development in nursing. The starting point was a former systematic review and additional searches were carried out using electronic databases with keywords and Boolean operators. The search followed the PRISMA search strategy and the articles were appraised against the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist.\\nThirty-four original research articles published between January 2004 and April 2020 were included. The data were displayed and analyzed descriptively. Results showed that the Nurse Competence Scale covers both ontological and contextual compe- tence, that the competence profiles vary in different cultures, cohorts and contexts, but that it is suitable for evaluating and following up competence development in nursing.

In fact, the potential of an event for starting a cascading failure depends on 20 many factors such as network structure, system operating point and nature of the event. In this 21 paper, based on the application of decision tree, a new approach is proposed for identifying 22 harmful line outages with the potential of starting and propagating cascading failures. For this 23 purpose, associated with each trajectory of the cascading failure, a blackout index is defined that 24 determines the potential of the initial event for triggering cascading failures towards power 25 system blackout. In order to estimate the blackout indices associated with a line outage, a three 26 stages harmful estimator decision tree (HEDT) is proposed. The proposed HEDT works based on 27 the online operating data provided by a wide area monitoring system (WAMS).

Mapping the History of Scenography Education in Finland Te article maps the development of scenography education in Finland from the early 1970s to the 2000s. Unlike all other disciplines of theatre making, the study program has been located at the University of Industrial Arts, which highlights the double character of scenography as both a visual and a perform- ative art. Te hegemonic comprehension of the subject has oscillated between independent design and participation in a collective process. Te key question that penetrates the curriculum throughout the decades is how to successfully construct a solid, material space for a temporary, more or less unpredictable theatrical event. Te scenographic methods that have been taught vary from the disciplined rational pre-planning and conceptual analysis of the 1970s, to the subjective individualism at the turn of the 1980s and 1990s, and \\ufb01nally to the interactive, self-regulating processes in the 2000s. Te di\\ufb00erent approaches are largely connected to individual teachers, but they can be further contextualized by looking at the more general cultural tendencies in art, theatre and society; as well as to the material conditions, changing university policies and respective organizational reformations.

BIOGRAPHY Laura Gr\\u00f6ndahl is a scenographer and theatre researcher, who is currently working on a research project on documentary theatre at Tampere University. Since taking her doctoral degree 2004 she has published several articles and acted regularly as a visiting lecturer at the Teatre Academy, and at the Universities of Lapland, Tampere and Helsinki, where she also holds the title of docent in thea- tre studies. She studied scenography in 1980-85, worked as a full-time practicing designer 1983-2002, and was the professor of Stage Design in 2006-13 at the University of Industrial Arts, Helsinki (from 2010 at the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture). laurakgrondahl@gmail.com 86 Nordic Theatre Studies vol. 27: no. 2\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"Stage Design at the Crossroad of Different Operational Cultures.

Video Still, 2011 Image Credit: Annette Arlander\\nIf we think of performative research as a specific research paradigm, as Brad Haseman (2006) and Barba- ra Bolt (2008) have argued, it will have implications for how we look at the impact of such work.1 If we accept that performative research does not describe phenomena but actually creates or shapes them, like a performative utterance, which does not describe phenomena (as constative utterances do) but actually does something in the world, we must commence our analysis by trying to ascertain what a specific re- search project has accomplished. According to Bolt the effects or consequences of a creative research pro- ject can be discursive, material or affective.2 But how we might evaluate \\u201ceffect\\u201d remains open. Bolt sug- gests that \\u201c[t]he problem for the creative arts researcher is recognizing and mapping the transformations that have occurred.\\u201d3 From the point of view of the artist and author there are mainly two indicators of transformation or impact: one\\u2019s own experience and feedback from viewers, in addition to possible mate- rial effects on the environment. I suggest that we distinguish between impact on the performer and impact on the viewer or the audience, as well as consider the consequences of the working process in addition to the consequences of the work itself. The working process might, for instance, produce unwelcome side- effects, like a possible heap of waste, not considered to be part of the actual work. 1 See Brad Haseman, \\u201cA Manifesto for Performative Research.\\u201d In Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy, theme issue \\u201cPractice-led-Research,\\u201d no. 118 (2006): 98-106; see also Barbara Bolt, \\u201cA Performative Paradigm for the Creative Arts?\\u201d\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"In discussions on performance documentation and on the changing notions of the live and the mediated, questions of the organically alive, the animate and the inanimate, are rarely posed.4 Nor is the importance of a living environment usually emphasized when the live encounter between performer and spectator is stressed. According to Teresa Brennan (2000), known to performance scholars mainly through Andr\\u00e9 Lepecki (2006), we should take seriously the indissolubility of individual and environment. Our tendency to assume ourselves as subjects in a world of objects is intensified in a manmade environment such as a contemporary city. Surrounded by commodities, which function like fantasies, the subject is more likely to see what it has made, rather than feel itself to be connected with, or part of, what has made it.5 Performing for a camera means using technology to create objects out of experiences. What I call perform- ing landscape is a technique for documenting performances and for producing artworks or \\u201csouvenirs\\u201d of changes that take place in the environment, thus combining technology (the camera) and experience (of the site, the repetition) in order to produce artworks that remain \\u2013 memorabilia of sorts. By returning to the same place once a week for one year and performing the same action in front of a camera that is placed in the same position, and then editing the takes, the slow processes in the environment can be con- densed and sped up in the video work. For the performer the act of returning to a site repeatedly produces almost the opposite effect, an extended encounter with the living environment, a kind of meditative prac- tice. Inevitably this way of creating \\u201cmementos of moments\\u201d in a landscape also means producing more inanimate objects, turning experiences of the living environment into commodities, into video works.\\nLike any form of recording, performing landscape for a camera preserves specific moments, and actively excludes others, like everything that remains outside the frame. It also excludes the experience of the per- former. What the performer senses and what the camera on a tripod records do not have much in com- mon. Unforeseen transformations in the environment over time can cause further complications, as in the example to be discussed in this text: Year of the Tiger (Arlander, 2011).6 On the site of this work, the vegeta- tion grew to such an extent that the performer could not be distinguished at all in long sequences, which caused me to ask in retrospect: how to document that which is hidden, that which is literally overgrown? This text will discuss some of the problems encountered when performing landscape \\u2013 live and alive. I begin by describing the project Year of the Tiger, after which I relate my work to Teresa Brennan\\u2019s ideas about the foundational fantasy that influences our relationship to the environment. I then explore Philip Auslander\\u2019s summary of the changes in our understanding of liveness, and finally, prompted by Barbara Bolt, I consider the question of impact with regards to the possible effects of this case of performing land- scape.7 4 For more on documentation, see: Angela Piccini and Caroline Rye, \\u201cOf Fevered Archives and The Quest for Total Documen- tation.\\u201d In Practice as Research in Performance and Screen, edited by Alleghue, Jones, Kershaw and Piccini (Basingstoke Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009): 34-49; For more on the live and the mediated, see: Philip Auslander, \\u201cThe Performativity of Perfor- mance Documentation,\\u201d Performing Arts Journal 84 volume 28 no 3 (New York: MIT Press Journals, September 2006): 1-10; Philip\"}, {\"page\": 8, \"text\": \"Round the Tiger.

Speaking about Reality: Verbatim techniques in contemporary Finnish documentary theatre LAURA GR\\u00d6NDAHL ABSTRACT During the past years, different modes of documentary theatre have gained popularity. A distinctive feature there is the use of verbatim texts, borrowed directly from authentic documents like recorded interviews or minutes, including sometimes even coincidental stuttering of the original speaker. In this article I analyse the verbatim-technique as part of the post-dramatic performance strategies. It makes it possible to focus on the materiality of language as a texture as well as an instrument for meaning making and communicating contents. It also gives a more active role to the audience. When texts are explicitly framed as authentic, and reiterated with exaggerated precision, the attention is drawn to the performative repetition of the speech acts. Thus, the verbatim performances do not so much refer to reality \\u201cas it is\\u201d, but rather stage acts of making claims about something we call reality. Borrowing Carol Martin, the contemporary generation of documentary theatre makers aspire to make relevant claims about social reality even if they use postmodern strategies and admit that truth and reality are not within their reach. I will discuss different strategies of using the verbatim techniques in documentary performances. I theorize the subject using well-known international examples, move on to a short overview of recent documentary theatre in Finland, and examine closer four cases: Parliament III in Ryhm\\u00e4teatteri in 201 5, Towards Work at Kouvolan Teatteri in 201 4, Ruusula Street 1 0 at Q-teatteri in 201 4, and My Palestine at Teatteri Takomo in 201 5.

Although they are no new phenomenon, different forms of documentary theatre have become unprecedentedly popular in the early 2000s. Instead of a fixed genre, there seems to be a variety of different practices of using recorded speech, authentic documents and witnesses as the primary, if not exclusive, material for the scripts. Documentary theatre is also called verba- tim, which literally means \\u201cin the exact words, word for word\\u201d1, because the spoken or written documents are often repeated in their original form in detail. To quote Derek Paget, the authentic source material \\u201cbecomes the true pro- tagonist in the drama.\\u201d2 The verbal language has thus a special role operating in-between the performative event and the socio-historical reality beyond theatre. In this article, I will examine how verbatim-techniques are used within recent Finnish documentary theatre performances. How do theatre makers collect quotations from various sources and frame them as authentic fragments from everyday life? How do they perform statements that are supposed to be taken as true? The key question is the relation between the raw data of the verbatim fragments and the knowledge that is produced by performing these spoken words on stage. Before presenting the Finnish cases, I will discuss some theoretical aspects of verbatim techniques in documentary performances using well-known international examples as a starting point.

Information and legitimacy: Results from an experimental survey on attitudes to the 2017 pension re- form in Finland Abstract The legitimacy of a pension system or any social security program depends on its credibility and per- ceived fairness. In order to gauge this legitimacy, we need to understand the relation between people\\u2019s knowledge and attitudes. This experimental survey into the role of knowledge and perceptions divided respondents into two groups: the \\u2018treatment\\u2019 group received an information letter about a forthcoming pension reform before they were interviewed, while the control group was interviewed without receiv- ing this \\u2018treatment\\u2019. Comparisons of the responses from the two groups allow us to assess how level of knowledge and the provision of information affect people\\u2019s opinions on policy reform. We also consider patterns of covariation between background factors, people\\u2019s concerns, and attitudes toward pension reform. The results show that the information letter had a significant impact on subjective but not on objective level of knowledge. Receiving the information letter improved acceptance and perceptions of the fairness of the reform.\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"1. Introduction Public attitudes are central to the legitimacy of political processes and democratic decision-making around social security systems. Politicians may be reluctant to propose and legislate social security reforms, for instance, if public sentiment is against them. But if public opinion is in favor and the proposed reforms are thought to be fair, then they have a better chance of making it through the political process of legislative amendment (see e.g. Svallfors, 2004; Brooks & Manza, 2006; Pierson, 2006; Hemerijck, 2013; Fern\\u00e1ndez & Jaime-Castillo, 2013; Chung et al., 2018). In order to have legitimacy, a social security program needs to be seen as credible and fair. Credibility depends on public perceptions of the long-term sustainability of the system, under the given economic and demographic challenges, and on the perceived adequacy of the protection provided by the system. Perceptions of fairness, then, depend on how people feel they and others are treated under the social security program. An informed opinion on the credibility and fairness of a social security program requires, first of all, an understanding of how the system works. This requires knowledge about the system itself and the challenges facing the system. People need to know what benefits are available through the system, but they must also have a sound factual basis on which to form their opinions (Chan & Stevens, 2004 and 2008). Population ageing and other socio-economic trends are putting pension systems under growing pressure in most OECD countries. These challenges call for reform and restructuring (see e.g. Natali 2017; OECD, 2019). However, popular support for existing pension schemes is strong, and any hint of change tends to be met with resistance \\u2013 especially if the reform involves cuts to pension benefits (see e.g. Myles & Pierson, 2001). How, then, to overcome this resistance to change; how to win over people?\"}]}"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "{\"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"Information and legitimacy : results from an experimental survey on attitudes to the 2017 pension reform in Finland\", \"doi\": \"10.1017/S1474747220000396\", \"type_coar\": \"journal article\"}"}]}

In source separated human urine, nutrient ratio is suitable for fertilizer use and nutrients are readily available for plants. In this study the aim was to acquire scientific data of the environmental impacts and nutrient potentials of wastewater separating systems, i.e. urine and blackwater source separation. At the same time, general acceptance on the use of human urine in agriculture wanted to be improved. In addition, the value of urine as a fertilizer was calculated. The focus of the study was on rural areas but comparison between different systems included also the nutrient potential of urban areas as well. Based on the results, human urine was found to be an environment friendly fertilizer. Applying source-separation systems in rural areas, four times more phosphorus and over thirty times more nitrogen could be recovered compared to the current wastewater treatment system. Furthermore, eutrophication impact is reduced to one fifth. However there is a risk of increased soil acidification but it can be minimized with advanced spreading techniques, like deep injection. The results of this study support the use of source-separation technologies for nutrient recovery. 1 Introduction\\nRecycling of nutrients is recognized as one of the key elements of the circular economy. This has been identified in several programs and targets nationally and internationally (Aho et al., 2015; EUR-Lex, 2015; Pantsar et al., 2016). Recent scientific discussion has brought up the question of the diminishing global phosphorus reserves and thus the urgent need to seek for alternative sources of phosphorus fertilization. Phosphorus is in many countries the limiting factor in food production. The availability of affordable mineral fertilizers is becoming more challenging and the prices are expected to rise (Cordell et al., 2011). It has been estimated, that there is relatively easily extractable phosphate rock reserves left for about 50-100 years (Cordell et al., 2009). Additionally, nitrogen fertilizer production is highly energy intensive. Therefore, we are soon facing a situation where more intensive nutrient reuse will be essential for producing food for the growing population. Thus, it is of utmost importance to seek means to reuse all human and animal excreta in food production in a safe and sustainable manner.\"}]}"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "{\"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"The role of source separation in nutrient recovery : comparison of alternative wastewater treatment systems\", \"creator\": [\"Malila, Riikka\", \"Lehtoranta, Suvi\", \"Viskari, Eeva-Liisa\"], \"year\": \"2019\", \"doi\": \"10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.024\", \"type_coar\": \"journal article\"}"}]}

This is realised by the close cooperation between educational institutions, enterprises and sector organisations from Norway, Island, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. The study tour was the first out of total of three and was focusing to study and create new services for the \\u00dclemiste Smart City. The aim of the Study Tour 1, named as \\u201cCreative Entrepreneurship\\u201d - was to organize creative entrepreneurial activities. Through the meetings, seminars and lectures experiences/ good practices and knowledge for the development of entrepreneurial mindset and knowledge between the International partners and experts were shared.

Both entrepreneurs are really passionate about their companies and are acting according their values. Common for both of them is also the novelty of their companies in Estonia. They have an unique approach in their area of business, possibly since they both are seeking and innovating new services and products followed by their passion. For instance Heili explains her passion to coffee: \\u201cWe had a cafe roaster, we wanted to treat coffee as vine to bring out different variety of beans.\\u201d In restaurant Juur your coffee is served from a large wine glass. The food courses are also served with a innovative twist to provide a unique flavour. Both entrepreneurs saw \\u00dclemiste Smart City as an interesting opportunity before moving there.

Moreover, the Scenario Filter Model (SFM) and its possibilities to produce future oriented service innovations and skill requirements are introduced. The scenario filter model (SFM) is a tool to generate a comprehensive set of scenarios and also to select ideas for further development and commercialization. The advantage of the SFM it that it combines three different perspectives so called filters: market, society and technology. The SFM also supports strategic decision making by helping e.g. in the timing of strategic actions. The research also gives new insights for services in the fields of citizen wellbeing and security by introducing four alternative scenarios and some examples of future service concepts which were created during this foresight process.

This type of \\u2018singing\\u2019 while learning to play an instrument may have similarities to the use of private speech in other types of learning tasks. This report describes a multiple case study based on the naturalistic observation of learners playing string instruments in different situations. We observed private rehearsals by six adult guitarists from different music cultures (classical, flamenco and jazz) who had different approaches to learning (traditional and constructivist). In addition, we observed the one-to-one lessons of a constructivist cello teacher with a 7-year-old beginner and a 12-year-old student. All sessions were recorded.

From the theoretical framework of private speech, we identified a set of qualities in private singing, such as whistling, humming, and guttural sounds, with different levels of audibility. Self-guidance and self-regulation appeared to be the functions underlying both psychomotor learning and reflective-emotional learning from an embodiment approach. Guitar learners from popular urban cultures seemed to use less explicit singing expression than classical guitar learners, the explicitness of which may be related to the instructional use of the notational system. In the one-to-one cello lessons, we observed a process of increasing internalisation from the younger to the older student. Both results are consistent with the literature on private speech, indicating that this process is a natural process of internalisation at higher literacy levels. Singing is not as frequent in music lessons as might be expected, and it is even less frequently used as a reflective tool or understood as an embodied process. The examples provided in this article shed light on the multiplicity of applications and on the potential benefits of private singing in instructional contexts as a powerful learning tool.

It is much more: it refers to teachers' interpretations and transformations of subject-matter knowledge in the context of facilitating student learning, not to speak of adding the teachers' self-knowledge and self-development. In doing so it encompasses understanding of common learning conditions. Having those ideas as a starting point, this study tries to analyze the writings of university employed teacher to see how they experienced and recollected their actions during teacher education and after it. The aim was to add the knowledge of the effectiveness of university teachers' pedagogical education and consider the possibilities of continuous promotion of academic teaching competence in higher education communities. The background of the research As part of a wider higher education (HE) pedagogy boom in Finland, a piloting teacher training program of 60 credits giving general pedagogical competence was planned jointly and realized in 2007\\u20132009 by the teachers of university and university of applied sciences (Kope-program). The program aimed at developing experimental knowledge of HE teachers' pedagogical conceptions and the practices promoting learning. In addition, the purpose was to promote the cooperation of different higher education implementers and the transmission of good practices. [1] [2]\\nAt the same time with the implementation, a longitudinal follow-up study was started to explain the realization of the aims and the effectiveness of the education. The earlier research consisted of three studies of joint planning [3] [4] [5], five separate studies of their implementation, and a follow-up study [1] [6] [7] [2] [8] [9]. The material [1] [7] was collected from essays, questionnaires, recorded group discussions and interviews. The research method was a case study. What is awareness? Awareness is the quality or state of being aware, knowledge and understanding that something is happening or exists (Merriam Webster dictionary). It is the state of being conscious of something. More specifically, is the ability to personally know and perceive, to feel, or to be cognizant of events. Besides perception of a situation or fact, it can also be concern about and well-informed interest in a situation or development. Types of awareness can be defined as: 1) time awareness, 2) task awareness, 3) result awareness and 4) self-awareness. Self-awareness is important because when we have a better understanding of ourselves, we can experience ourselves as unique and separate individuals. We are then empowered to make changes and to build on our\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"areas of strength as well as identify areas where we would like to make improvements. To raise awareness is also to inform and educate people about a topic or issue with the intention of influencing their attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs towards the achievement of a defined purpose or goal. This research divides the conception of awareness into personal, task, process, and professional pedagogical awareness types, which roughly correspond to the above defined types of awareness. The current research To get a conception of an individual academic teacher's pedagogical awareness and evaluation of pedagogical studies, follow-up group discussions were arranged, recorded, and transcribed at the end of 2015. The research persons (N=19) had passed pedagogical education in 2008\\u20132014. The data included 248 statements. The analyzing method was a qualitative case study, the analysis unit being a word or a group of words expressing one meaning. The respondents are called teachers in this study. The terms \\\"pedagogical awareness\\\", \\\"practical knowledge\\\" and \\\"personal knowledge\\\" are used as a combination of all teachers' cognitions, such as declarative and procedural knowledge, and beliefs and values that influence their teaching activities. The research approach is phenomenography, a theory of how to describe manifestations of human experience and qualitative differences. The object of analysis consists of expressed experiences. It is argued [10] that people\\u2019s different ways of understanding or experiencing the surrounding world is all there is. We may then compare different understandings with each other, but we cannot compare their understandings with the reality itself.\\nInterview themes were chosen according to the seven principles of any academic teacher. They are: 1. Commitment to the interdisciplinary scientific work, teaching and learning that are required from his/ her own discipline and scientific community 2. Commitment to research-based and reflective practices 3. Positive attitude to challenges and changes with good communicative and problem-solving skill 4. Active participation in national and international networks and their promotion 5. Ability to understand and apply modern learning-centered teaching and evaluation methods 6. Positive attitude to work and work community, and ability to take responsibility as a leader and mentor in his/her organization 7. Ability and willingness to support favorable cooperation with the partners inside and outside the academic world with expert level skills in communication The interview moved freely between the themes, partly intersecting them. The themes were intended to seem easy but to inspire the respondents to discuss of their experiences. The authors participated in the interview only by regulating the discussion so that as many themes as possible could be dealt with. Research questions 1. What key experiences of learning and teaching were identified by the teachers during and after their pedagogical education? 2.

Finland is a world leader in the use of public electronic services. Continuous improvement to competencies is a prerequisite for the success of digitalisation in the service development sector. The increasing use of information technology in health and social care needs to be taken into account in the education of the health and social care sector work force. The mandate of the national SotePeda 24/7 project is to identify and define the informatics competencies required for multidisciplinary education of this sector in Finland. The project has adapted international recommendations for use in the national context. The national recommendation covers 12 areas of competency and related content. In addition to defining competencies, the project has produced a toolbox of materials for use by educators of these topics in universities that cover applied sciences and lifelong learning. The results of the project are expected to significantly improve the preparedness of graduating health and social care and related engineering and business sector students to make full use information technology, all of which benefits the national health and social welfare system.

While theoretical discussion has been vivid especially on value co-creation in the recent years, the traditional marketing terminology still implies the firm\\u2018s dominant position for value creation [1]. We argue that analyzing value creation and co-creation from the customer perspective better supports the analytical constructs of value creation and co- creation. The literature on the service-dominant logic (SDL), highlights that service ultimately must be experienced by the customer through resource integration [2,3]. Resource integration is one of the key principles in service-dominant logic [2-4]which highlight the networked world and strongly suggest to include all parties into the engagement of value creation as resources-providing actors. Further, we investigate, how these networks are functioning; where and how these operant resources [2] could interact. Our proposal is a concept of joint service sphere. The joint service sphere is the locus \\u2013 whereabouts \\u2013 where actors integrate their own resources and apply in interaction resources provided by other actors.

Guadalupe L\\u00f3pez-\\u00cd\\u00f1iguez Sibelius Academy, University of the Arts Helsinki, Finland Pamela Burnard Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge, UK Abstract Making sense of musicians\\u2019 professional learning pathways is of crucial importance to understanding their career progressions, their routes into creative employment, and the relevance of various policies to their professional lives. However, this is a far cry from understanding how critical reflection catalyzes diverse learning routes, especially when considering evidence originating from postgraduate musicians\\u2019 own accounts of their journeys into job creation. In this study, we invited five postgraduate classical musicians who were invested in professional learning through performance programs in higher education to contribute these types of personal perspectives. The article explores the value of postgraduate musicians\\u2019 own accounts of their journeys and illustrates how a more nuanced understanding of them can be arrived at through the use of visual-based tools, for example, Rivers of Musical Experience and Dixit Cards. This constructivist intervention prompted both group and individual critical reflections, as well as sense-making processes that enabled the participants to become more informed about the (typically overlooked or neglected) critical incidents that differently catalyze professional learning pathways. All of the participants articulated sociocultural influences that were situated along historical, present, and future points of departure and arrival, helping them to create meaning and understanding of themselves and their (at times unsettling) professional learning pathways. From the ensuing thematic analyses, we identified a commonality of themes across life phases with three key influential groups of people (parents, peers, and professionals) that strongly affected their professional learning pathways and learner identity- construction. The results indicate that the relationships between these phases and people are complex. The research illuminates the previously unexplored connection between the meaning-making trajectories that are instantiated through critical reflection, and adds to our understanding of the development of musicians\\u2019 professional learning pathways and learner identities.

Large numbers of postgraduate musicians return to university settings to complete Higher Music Education courses to acquire new skills. Professional learning opportunities, as exemplified for postgradu- ate musicians, involve some of the most complex and fast-moving work contexts in existence (e.g., Burnard, 2019). The professional learning pathways and learner identities of musicians are understood as dialectical, dynamic, and fluid (Lawson, 2014; Turner & Tobbell, 2017); as living phenomena maximizing the impact of chances and choices during the process of finding or creating new music careers (see recent report in the United Kingdom by Bloom, 2020). In a study of identity and its relationship to cultivating a music career, Hracs (2010) found that self- reflexivity is increasingly important to the ways in which professionals engage, seize opportuni- ties, and manage risk across their practices. Fostering the development of professional learning pathways for postgraduate musicians involves adapting and developing innovations that they perceive to be pragmatically valuable; however, trying their best to dutifully learn from critical reflection practices in their professional life may not align with or be supported by significant changes in the professional learning pathways of the careers of postgraduate musicians.

With hybridity, I mean bringing together people who otherwise would not be in contact with each other, and being open to their stories, situations and conceptions of art (see Bhabha, 1994). To this ephemeral community, I invite people from different social backgrounds to collectively create a joint piece of art, most often a performance with documentary traits. In the hybrid community of artistic expression, the very basic theatrical exercise is about how to take the other person\\u2019s position. It can be described as an identity game of imagining what it is like for me to be you (Goldman 2012). Forming a hybrid community of artistic expression can be seen as a method of making a documentary theatre performance with a special emphasis on the notion of community. It illuminates the situations of differently marginalized people and makes them more understandable and visible to others within the broader society. This way, putting oneself in the position of others could also be regarded as an act of civic awareness. It is an artistic and social experiment of living with the politics of difference, as sociologist Stuart Hall (1987) might put it. Other home as a hybrid community of artistic expression\\nOther home (Toinen koti) was a project formulated around the idea of a hybrid community of artistic expression. The community involved participants from three roughly defined grups of people brought together in the context of a theatre production. These people were: 1) professional refugee artists, 2) professional artists with a background in Finland and 3) amateurs who had participated in a theatre workshop open for refugees, and who now wanted to join the performance as members of the chorus. The project\\u2019s aim was to give voice to people in a vulnerable position, by giving them the opportunity to tell their stories in a way that could not really have worked with any other cast.

In theatre we, however, tend to highly value the idea, or the ideal, of a community.\\nFor me, the basic elements of a community that appeared in the Other home project can be illuminated with the help of four classical sociological concepts. 1) Communitas. Other Home had elements of something that the anthropologist Victor Turner (1995) calls communitas. This is a special sense of equality between subjects of a ritual. Communitas is existential and anti-structural by its very nature and functions as a counterforce to the hierarchical side of the society. It represents the power of the oppressed, in this case the voices of the people with a refugee background. In Other home, the ultimate expression of structure was in texts from the Finnish Immigration Service, which also formed a part of the dramatic plot of the performance. 2) Liminality. Referring to Arnold Van Gennep, Victor Turner (1995) also talks about liminality, which can be described as a basic characteristic for a person or a community in transition. The status of an asylum seeker or a refugee is liminal: non-belonging to the country of origin anymore and non-belonging to the present society yet (Butler & Spivak, 2007). Artists are, according to Turner, in a constant state of liminality as they work as agents for a change. In this way, many members of the Other home community had a double liminal identity: as refugees and as artists. 3) Stigma. Another sociological concept that was crucial to the community of Other home is Erving Goffmann\\u2019s stigma (1986). It is a trait in a person or a group of individuals that can be conceived as inferior or \\u201cspoiling the identity\\u201d in the eyes of the wider society. Belonging in a minority ethnic group or being a refugee is typically a stigma. In the Other home community, the aim was to show everybody on the stage as full identities and empower them by giving them a chance to talk for themselves. 4) Imagined community.\"}, {\"page\": 6, \"text\": \"Lehtonen and professor of linguistic ethnography Sari P\\u00f6yh\\u00f6nen from the University of Jyv\\u00e4skyl\\u00e4.\"}]}"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "{\"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"Imagining what it is like to be you : challenges of a hybrid community\", \"creator\": [\"Lehtonen, Jussi\"], \"type_coar\": \"journal article\"}"}]}

There are so many variables, the objects themselves are absent, and the moment of production is the mo- ment of consumption. Although the script may still exist, it is unlikely to contain any indications of acting styles or the actors\\u2019 accents. This article will focus on a number of performances of two famous actors from the early years of the Finnish language theatre. Charlotte Raa (1838\\u20131907) had the leading role in the \\u201cfirst\\u201d Finnish language theatre performance, while Ida Aalberg (1858\\u20131915) was the first Finnish star actor who performed both in the Nordic countries and in Europe. Their non-native accent did not serve a dramaturgical function in their performances and was, therefore, read both against the artistic heritage and world, in this case, the ideological climate of the time. INTRODUCTION The aim in this article is to explore the responses to two cases of intersemiotic translation where an accent, which has not been indicated in the script, has appeared as a consequence of the non-nativeness of the actor. The material of the study consists of the performances of two actors, the Sweden Swedish Hedvig Charlotte Raa (1838\\u20131907) and the Finland Finnish Ida Aalberg (1858\\u2013 1915) in the second half of the 19th century. Neither performed in their mother tongue; Raa performed in Finnish and Aalberg in Finland Swedish, Danish and\\nGerman. The evidence of the reception of their performances will be drawn from historiographies and their documentation of mainly newspaper reviews. The research question will concern the reasons for the variation between positive and negative reaction to the actors\\u2019 delivery of their lines in a language variety which was not theirs. Theatre translation may involve three types of translation, that is, there are three ways of interpreting a verbal sign. According to Roman Jakobson (1959: 233), the three types consist of intralingual translation, that is, rewording of verbal signs by means of other signs in the same language. Secondly, in inter- lingual translation, translation proper, verbal signs are interpreted by means of some other language, and, finally, intersemiotic translation, or transmuta- tion involves an interpretation of verbal signs by means of signs of nonverbal sign systems. In staged performance, intralingual translation might include Ritva Hartama-Heinonen & Pirjo Kukkonen (eds.) Marginalia Acta Translatologica Helsingiensia (ATH) Vol 4, 61\\u201379. 2020. Helsinki: University of Helsinki, Nordica, Swedish Translation Studies.\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"Marginalia replacement of one dialect by another for purposes of localisation (see the ex- ample of Masj\\u00e4vlar below), interlingual translation would be needed in staging\\nFinnish plays abroad and, the other way round, translation of foreign plays for staging in Finland. Intersemiotic translation in theatre refers to the fleshing out of the script, the bringing together of the actor\\u2019s body and the script, stage, lighting, music, costume, makeup and special effects. In this article, a foreign accent is regarded as deriving from intersemiotic translation. Research into intersemiotic translation in theatre has produced mainly case studies (e.g. Aal- tonen 2007, 2010), whereas theatre studies have largely focused on the type of relationship between the text and performance (e.g. Carlson 1985; Vanden Heu- vel 1993), or staged performance as a process (Chauduri 1999). Research into intersemiotic translation is complicated by the fact that staged performances are events of the past and, therefore, not directly accessible to researchers. Instead, as Thomas Postlewait (1991: 158) has pointed out, they have to rely on second- ary evidence from often random documentation. According to him, documents, then, are also products of their time, drawing upon presuppositions of complex theoretical ideas such as cultural ideologies, narrative paradigms and principles of causality or contiguity.

Design/methodology/approach \\u2013 Data collection comprised semi-structured interviews with Finnish local residents and entrepreneurs; these were supplemented with secondary data including books, articles, advertisements and documents referencing sauna in the context of Finland.\\nFindings \\u2013 The analysis and interpretation by the authors show that the symbolic resource of sauna constitutes the legitimation of Finnish nation branding discourses at three levels: regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive; we label these sauna governance, communal identity creation and mythmaking, respectively. Originality/value \\u2013 The research contribution reveals that nation branding discourses are also forms of legitimation work. Finnish nation branding discourses are interwoven with sauna as the symbolic resource of \\u201cFinnishness\\u201d and become conduits for the expression of discursive meanings. This demonstrates that institutional legitimacy is an intrinsic aspect of the ways place branding discourses can be used as a mode of governance (i.e. a policy instrument).

Collectively, these cultural resources are managed to build the image or identity of a place \\u2013 city or region \\u2013 in a positive way, which confers what is commonly described as reputation (Bell, 2016). For example, \\u201cNordicness\\u201d, as a place brand, is unique in that its reputation is not con\\ufb01ned to a region, but is rather an idea that transverses geographical bounds (Cassinger et al., 2018; Pietil\\u00e4 et al., 2019). At the heart of this \\u201creputational capital\\u201d (Bell, 2016), symbolic resources function as conduits for place branding discourses and expressions of discursive meanings (Kaneva, 2011; Varga, 2013). Cassinger et al. (2016, p. 181) argue that the meaning-making process connected to nation branding resources (ideas, practices or con\\ufb01gurations) is dynamic, that is contextually, temporally and spatially bound. While foregrounding the role of institutional actors, they maintain that this process requires consensus, mutual understanding and \\u201csupport from the population\\u201d. The meaning of place branding and regionalisation discourse depends, therefore, not only on the institutional context but also on the citizen participants who shape and reiterate what is legitimate or \\u201cdesirable, proper, or appropriate\\u201d (Suchman, 1995, p. 574). The purpose of this study is to explore institutional legitimation processes in the production of Finnish national identity through place branding discourses. The institutional legitimacy of a place branding discourse is an ongoing set of individual and social processes established in an apparent collective acceptance by local community members as desirable or suitable (Brown and Toyoki, 2013; Suchman, 1995). Substantial research has been devoted to understanding the external legitimacy of place brands; this includes the ecology or environments that place brands exist, their envelopment in neoliberal discourses (Lucarelli, 2018; Varga, 2013), as well as the various stakeholders involved, including government regulators, foreign diplomacy makers, marketers, tourists, transnational corporations, product brands and employees (Cassinger et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2003). Far less attention has been paid to internal legitimacy, afforded by a nation\\u2019s inhabitants or residents (Braun et al., 2013; Lichrou et al., 2017; Warnaby and Medway, 2013), and its import for the stability and institutionalisation of place branding discourses. The relevance of this, we suggest, sits in uncovering how place branding discourses may function as a form of internal legitimation for national identity among internal stakeholders who, until now, have been underexamined; and how this discursive work unfolds around symbolic resources, co-constituting place brands through bottom-up processes of legitimation work. Building on previous research adopting a cultural approach (Bianchini and Ghilardi, 2007), place branding is understood as a dynamic communication process whereby the institutional legitimation of national identity can be seen as a policy instrument (Lucarelli and Giovanardi, 2014). Understanding legitimation work as a malleable discursive resource embedded in a dynamic interplay of consensus and contestation, \\u201ctalked and written continuously into and out of existence\\u201d through place branding discursive work (Brown and Toyoki, 2013, p. 867), becomes relevant as language is a signi\\ufb01cant \\u201cmedium of social control and power\\u201d that represents modes of brand governance (Fairclough, 1989, p. 3). As place-branding studies have generally prioritised external stakeholders (Warnaby and Medway, 2013), far less attention has been paid to local voices and how they sustain and repudiate \\u201cexisting social and power relations\\u201d through processes of governance (Fairclough, 1995, p. 77). Based on an in-depth case study of sauna in Finland, we attend to these underexamined internal stakeholders, analysing how inhabitants\\u2019 talk functions as internal legitimacy work.\"}]}"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "{\"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"The spirit of sauna : legitimating the Finnish place brand\", \"creator\": [\"Tillotson, Jack S.\", \"Tassiello, Vito\", \"Rome, Alexandra S.\", \"Helaniemi, Katariina\"], \"year\": \"2020\", \"publisher\": [\"Emerald\"], \"doi\": \"10.1108/JPMD-12-2019-0109\", \"p-issn\": \"1753-8335\", \"type_coar\": \"research article\"}"}]}

In an attempt to bring gender into conversation with the concept of sphere of influence, the article shows the tensions between militarist masculinity and queer subjectivity. In House of Cards, the viewer can identify statecraft as mancraft, and see how nonnormative behaviour is written off statecraft.\\nThe article focuses on bodily performances as signs of different approaches to power, and argues that House of Cards reinforces a militarised ideal of power over in the everyday practices in and around the White House, as well as in the form of spheres of influence. The series produces a choreography of militarist performance, an imagery which reinforces the understanding of world politics as a terrain for establishing spheres of influence. In the series, spheres of influence become manifest through the exacerbating of patriarchal conduct and centralisation of power, as well as in the premise of building security on the basis of enmities and influence. Sphere of influence, thus, represents a form of masculinised order, pinned against feminised anarchy, leading not only to the subordination of the influenced state, but nonnormative subjectivities, in particular.\"}, {\"page\": 2, \"text\": \"Introduction This article discusses how gendered states and their spheres of influence are produced in human form by the political television drama of Netflix House of Cards. I have chosen a popular culture artefact to look into spheres of influence because it represents states in the form of human bodies, and specifically, gendered bodies for popular consumption. I investigate the ways in which gender relates to different forms of power, and specifically power extended beyond the borders of a sovereign state, by connecting anthropomorphism (state as person) with feminist and queer theory on the gendered performance of the state. I argue that in House of Cards, spheres of influence are related to a militarised form of masculinity in which violent solutions are preferred and celebrated. I focus on season 3 which introduced spheres of influence in the form a US\\u2013Russia rivalry in the Middle East. I propose the following: House of Cards reproduces gender binaries in terms of power and leadership, which translates to the gendering of the state and its policy of asserting spheres of influence. Even though Frank and Claire Underwood each embody queer subjectivity (more than one sexuality), a binary logic of gender still permeates the understanding of (international) politics in House of Cards. Gender here is understood as \\u201ca system of symbolic meaning that creates social hierarchies based on perceived associations with masculine and feminine characteristics\\u201d (Sjoberg 2009a, 3) and more specifically, following Judith\\nButler, as a performance, the action which produces the actor through repetition and naturalisation (Butler 1999). In House of Cards manliness is choreographed and performed as the imperturbable and militaristic subject, the natural embodiment of power. The reading of House of Cards here adds an important element to the conceptual and empirical work on spheres of influence in this special issue, and elsewhere (Hast 2014), by reading configurations of power in bodily choreographies. A feminist critique of power over proposes that states and people without power of domination have other means available, such as power to resist and power with others or power as collaboration (Sjoberg 2009b). While power is typically related to the ideas of control, authority or the ability to rule and govern (Staeheli and Kofman 2004, 6), an expanded understanding of power suggests multifaceted, diffuse and relational power. Contrary to such broad view of power, the conceptualisation of sphere of influence assumes an \\u201cinfluencing state\\u201d having power over the \\u201cinfluenced state\\u201d. This is seen as a static and immutable relationship of paternalism over the governed and controlled (Keal 1983). House of Cards adheres to such an idea of power over the influenced states, a system of control and authority. At the same time, the choreography of Claire Underwood demonstrates how other forms of power exist, but they would need to be accompanied by a feminist agenda in order to challenge the role of women under the structures of power. The article first discusses how spheres of influence are gendered and militarised\"}]}"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "{\"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"Bodily states on screen: gendering Spheres of influence in House of Cards\", \"creator\": [\"Hast, Susanna\"], \"year\": \"2018\", \"publisher\": [\"Taylor & Francis\"], \"doi\": \"10.1080/14650045.2018.1451844\", \"type_coar\": \"journal article\"}"}]}

The national innovation systems and foresight practices are running well among large corporations. However, SMEs\\u2019 needs and skills are different from the institutional purposes of these systems. SMEs\\u2019 challenges for the future success are mostly related to their position in the value chain / network as well as to the limited resources for the strategic work and development activities. Also, SMEs\\u2019 role in the local community is often important as an employer and as a voice of entrepreneurs to the municipalities. Therefore, the renewal of SMEs is not only important to the companies themselves, but also for the region. The regional forums for innovation and foresight have to be developed from the perspective of SMEs, supporting their renewal and ability to grow and follow trends and signals of the future.

Low-educated workers tend to leave the labour market earlier than the high-edu- cated, which creates educational inequalities in the employment rates of older workers. Yet relatively little is known about how large these inequalities are and how they have developed across time. If the employment rates of older workers are rising but educational inequalities remain stable or increase, policymakers may need to reconsider ways of making the extension of working lives more inclusive. Studying educational inequalities in the employment of older workers across time is com- plicated by the fact that the educational structure of the population continues to change. Cohorts that now approach the retirement age have a considerably higher education than cohorts that retired fifteen years ago. This educational expansion has had a positive effect on extending working lives [1]. However, while it is possible that the overall inequalities between older workers in society have declined because the share of high-educated people has increased, the relative disadvantages for the low-educated groups may have remained the same or even grown in younger cohorts. Finland makes an interesting case for studying educational inequalities in employment for several reasons. While the employment rate in the age group 55\\u201364 years was only around 35 percent in the mid-1990s, it has increased to more than 60 percent in recent years. A series of pension reforms during this period explicitly aimed at extending working lives and increasing the employment of older workers. At the same time, over the past decades, the share of people who have completed tertiary education has risen drastically in this age group while the share of those with low qualifications continues to decline (see S1 Table in S1 File). Currently, Finland is one of the countries in Europe with the most highly educated older workforce. However, at the present, there is no information on whether the rise in the employment rate has occurred in all pre- or post-retirement-age groups and on all educational levels. Finland could forebode of how the educational inequalities in employment of older people will develop in other countries. This study explores employment of 60\\u201368-year-old men and women by educational level over the period 2006\\u20132018 and the magnitude of educational inequalities in employment. We propose a novel method to analyse both absolute and relative educational inequalities in employment. Using exceptional register data for the entire Finnish population allows us to observe employment rates in smaller-than-usual age brackets and to disaggregate these by gen- der and level of education. We analyse employment levels and educational inequalities among three age groups: 1) those that are approaching their retirement age (60\\u201362 years), 2) those that are eligible for an old-age pension but have incentives and often good opportunities to continue working (63\\u201365 years), and 3) those that possibly face increasing obstacles and disin- centives to continue working (66\\u201368 years). We observe trends in employment and educa- tional inequalities in these age groups between 2006 and 2018. This article is organised as follows. The following section introduces previous literature on educational inequalities in employment at older age and describes changes in the incentives for employment at older age in the Finnish pension system. Section 3 describes the data and methods. Section 4 presents our findings, which are discussed further in section 5. Background Educational inequalities in employment at older age Studies have identified numerous mechanisms behind the early exit and lower employment rates of low-educated older workers. First, a lower socioeconomic status is associated with poorer health, which may limit possibilities to continue work [17\\u201325].

Outshoot of this interest are entrepreneurship programs, which train and fund nascent entrepreneurs with university background. These programs utilize a plethora of well studied innovation and entrepreneurship tools. What is not well understood, however, is how we should factor in the unique motivations and needs of the entrepreneurs themselves. The current entrepreneurial motivation research has the problem of being too abstract to be practically useful for program managers. In this paper, we hope to find a new research methodology and as a result claim to have found one in object-process methodogy (OPM). We demonstrate the applicability of the methodology by using it to model a Finnish university-funded micro-funding program targeting students and researchers with new innovative business ideas. Key Words entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship programs, object-process methodology, entrepreneurial motivation JEL Classification: C21, R13 Introduction\\nThere exists a lot of research about and methods for nascent entrepreneurs andorganizations involved in the process of developing new business opportunities.

Methods like the discovery-driven planning by McGrath and MacMillan (1995),the lean startup by Eric Ries (2011), the DEFT by Innosight\\u2019s Scott Anthony (2014) arefocused on testing and validating business ideas efficiently.

More approaches include Outcome-Driven Innovation by Strategyn\\u2019sAnthony Ullwick (2005) and the Jobs-to-be-Done theory by Clayton Christensen et al.(2016), which focus on recognizing and understating the customer needs deeply beforeputting actual effort in developing and implementing any business ideas based on them.Another set of tools and thinking utilized in many programs is the design thinkingapproach made famous during the 90s by design company IDEO (Camacho, 2016).

ABSTRACT In this paper, a direct power control (DPC) approach is proposed for grid-tied AC MG\\u2019s photovoltaic (PV) voltage source inverter (VSI) to regulate directly active and reactive powers by modulating microgrid\\u2019s (MG) point of common coupling (PCC) voltage. The proposed PCC voltage modulated (PVM) theory-based DPC method (PVMT-DPC) is composed of nonlinear PVM, nonlinear damping, conventional feedforward, and feedback PI controllers. For grid synchronization rather than employing phase-locked- loop (PLL) technology, in this study, direct power calculation of the PCC voltage and current is adopted. Subsequently, at PCC, the computed real and reactive powers are compared with reference powers in order to generate the VSI\\u2019s control signals using sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM). Because of the absence of the PLL and DPC method adoption, the suggested controller has a faster convergence rate compared to traditional VSI power controllers. Additionally, it displays nearly zero steady-state power oscillations, which assures that MG\\u2019s power quality is improved signi\\ufb01cantly. To validate the proposed PVMT-DPC method\\u2019s performance real-time simulations are conducted via a real-time digital simulator (RTDS) for a variety of cases. The results demonstrate that PV VSI using the suggested PVMT-DPC approach can track the reference power quicker (0.055 s) along with very low steady-state power oscillations, and lower total harmonic distortion (THD) of 1.697% at VSI output current.
