      "Abstract\n",
      "This article considers the ontological premises for tools in artists’ education, specifically in choreography studies at the master-of-arts level. The topic has proven to be crucial in planning and executing a curriculum of study in the contemporary age of pluralistic aesthetic intentions as any tool, as habitually understood, is ready-to-use according to its disclosed purpose and thus has, in a way, already solved some aspects of the singular research question posed between the artist and the prevailing world. The topic of tools turns out to be a wider question of contemporary poetics (techniques, methods, knowledge) and of ontological considerations of the nature of poiesis and artwork.\n",
      "The topic of contemporary poetics was extensively discussed in a 2011-2013 Erasmus Intensive project, which was an educational collaboration among six European master’s programmes in dance and physically based performance in which the writer took part. This article reports some aspects of that discussion and elaborates on a traditionally widely used concept in choreography education— namely, composition. The article tackles the complex issue of poetics and tools by, firstly, discussing poiesis and the causes to which artwork is indebted and, secondly, by searching in some ontological premises for the notion of composition. The article presents a view of composition derived from Martin Heidegger’s elaborations of logos: logos is letting something been seen it its togetherness with something – letting it been seen as something. (Heidegger 1962, 56). Following this notion, I propose a view to composition as a certain togetherness in relatedness in which case the concept of composition might serve both as reflective knowledge of construction and as a deep research question in artists’ creative processes.\n",

      "Pedagogical awareness is sometimes equalled either to knowledge of the contents and discipline or, more often, to pedagogical measures. It is much more: it refers to teachers' interpretations and transformations of subject-matter knowledge in the context of facilitating student learning, not to speak of adding the teachers' self-knowledge and self-development. In doing so it encompasses understanding of common learning conditions. Having those ideas as a starting point, this study tries to analyze the writings of university employed teacher to see how they experienced and recollected their actions during teacher education and after it. The aim was to add the knowledge of the effectiveness of university teachers' pedagogical education and consider the possibilities of continuous promotion of academic teaching competence in higher education communities.\n",

The program aimed at developing experimental knowledge of HE teachers' pedagogical conceptions and the practices promoting learning.

      "The aim of this paper is to explore a range of largely embodied vocalisations and sounds produced by learners of string instruments and how they relate to the potential self- regulatory use provided by such vocalisations. This type of ‘singing’ while learning to play an instrument may have similarities to the use of private speech in other types of learning tasks. This report describes a multiple case study based on the naturalistic observation of learners playing string instruments in different situations. We observed private rehearsals by six adult guitarists from different music cultures (classical, flamenco and jazz) who had different approaches to learning (traditional and constructivist). In addition, we observed the one-to-one lessons of a constructivist cello teacher with a 7-year-old beginner and a 12-year-old student. All sessions were recorded. We applied the System for Analysing the Practice of Instrumental Lessons to 1\n",

      "Over the past few years I have been developing the idea of a hybrid community of artistic expression (Lehtonen 2016; Lehtonen & Pöyhönen, 2018). With hybridity, I mean bringing together people who otherwise would not be in contact with each other, and being open to their stories, situations and conceptions of art (see Bhabha, 1994). To this ephemeral community, I invite people from different social backgrounds to collectively create a joint piece of art, most often a performance with documentary traits. In the hybrid community of artistic expression, the very basic theatrical exercise is about how to take the other person’s position. It can be described as an identity game of imagining what it is like for me to be you (Goldman 2012).\n",
      "Forming a hybrid community of artistic expression can be seen as a method of making a documentary theatre performance with a special emphasis on the notion of community. It illuminates the situations of differently marginalized people and makes them more understandable and visible to others within the broader society. This way, putting oneself in the position of others could also be regarded as an act of civic awareness. It is an artistic and social experiment of living with the politics of difference, as sociologist Stuart Hall (1987) might put it.\n",

      "If we think of performative research as a specific research paradigm, as Brad Haseman (2006) and Barba- ra Bolt (2008) have argued, it will have implications for how we look at the impact of such work.1 If we accept that performative research does not describe phenomena but actually creates or shapes them, like a performative utterance, which does not describe phenomena (as constative utterances do) but actually does something in the world, we must commence our analysis by trying to ascertain what a specific re- search project has accomplished. According to Bolt the effects or consequences of a creative research pro- ject can be discursive, material or affective.2 But how we might evaluate “effect” remains open. Bolt sug- gests that “[t]he problem for the creative arts researcher is recognizing and mapping the transformations that have occurred.”3 From the point of view of the artist and author there are mainly two indicators of transformation or impact: one’s own experience and feedback from viewers, in addition to possible mate- rial effects on the environment. I suggest that we distinguish between impact on the performer and impact on the viewer or the audience, as well as consider the consequences of the working process in addition to the consequences of the work itself. The working process might, for instance, produce unwelcome side- effects, like a possible heap of waste, not considered to be part of the actual work. 1 See Brad Haseman, “A Manifesto for Performative Research.” In Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy, theme issue “Practice-led-Research,” no. 118 (2006): 98-106; see also Barbara Bolt, “A Performative Paradigm for the Creative Arts?”\n",

      "Abstract: According to the philosopher Fabián Ludueña, before biopolitics, Rome and Greece put in motion the zoopolitics of an Anthropotechnical machine. The practice of expositio is the foundational zoopolitical human gesture. It consisted of leaving new-born children exposed at street markets to be sold as slaves, or in nature, left to survive (or die). The spectres of those body-minds still haunt our onto-epistemologies: by creatively fabulating with Ludueña’s work, I suggest looking back to the broken chains of the production of able bodies instead of perpetuating the reproductive futurity. Ludueña’s work investigates how and why the figure of the spectre gradually disappeared from the discursive milieu, and why it needs to be brought back into the spotlight. Its potential resides in its existence between binary categories like God and human, man and animal, male and female. It queers, defying epistemological boundaries, what it means to be dead or alive. Melanie Yergeau employs the term “neuroqueer” to talk about the non-neurotypical and queer subjectivities that are a continuum of indiscernibility and are violently dislodged into binary categories.\n",
      "In the conclusion, I argue for operationalising the concept of the spectre to help to short-circuit the able- neurotypical and heteronormative futurism, looking back to the ghosts of the exposed children.\n",

Speaking about Reality: Verbatim techniques in contemporary Finnish documentary theatre LAURA GRÖNDAHL ABSTRACT During the past years, different modes of documentary theatre have gained popularity. A distinctive feature there is the use of verbatim texts, borrowed directly from authentic documents like recorded interviews or minutes, including sometimes even coincidental stuttering of the original speaker. In this article I analyse the verbatim-technique as part of the post-dramatic performance strategies. It makes it possible to focus on the materiality of language as a texture as well as an instrument for meaning making and communicating contents. It also gives a more active role to the audience. When texts are explicitly framed as authentic, and reiterated with exaggerated precision, the attention is drawn to the performative repetition of the speech acts. Thus, the verbatim performances do not so much refer to reality “as it is”, but rather stage acts of making claims about something we call reality. Borrowing Carol Martin, the contemporary generation of documentary theatre makers aspire to make relevant claims about social reality even if they use postmodern strategies and admit that truth and reality are not within their reach. I will discuss different strategies of using the verbatim techniques in documentary performances. I theorize the subject using well-known international examples, move on to a short overview of recent documentary theatre in Finland, and examine closer four cases: Parliament III in Ryhmäteatteri in 201 5, Towards Work at Kouvolan Teatteri in 201 4, Ruusula Street 1 0 at Q-teatteri in 201 4, and My Palestine at Teatteri Takomo in 201 5.

Mapping the History of Scenography Education in Finland Te article maps the development of scenography education in Finland from the early 1970s to the 2000s. Unlike all other disciplines of theatre making, the study program has been located at the University of Industrial Arts, which highlights the double character of scenography as both a visual and a perform- ative art. Te hegemonic comprehension of the subject has oscillated between independent design and participation in a collective process. Te key question that penetrates the curriculum throughout the decades is how to successfully construct a solid, material space for a temporary, more or less unpredictable theatrical event. Te scenographic methods that have been taught vary from the disciplined rational pre-planning and conceptual analysis of the 1970s, to the subjective individualism at the turn of the 1980s and 1990s, and ﬁnally to the interactive, self-regulating processes in the 2000s. Te diﬀerent approaches are largely connected to individual teachers, but they can be further contextualized by looking at the more general cultural tendencies in art, theatre and society; as well as to the material conditions, changing university policies and respective organizational reformations. Keywords: scenography, stage design, University of Industrial Arts, Helsinki, theatre education, theatre professions. BIOGRAPHY Laura Gröndahl is a scenographer and theatre researcher, who is currently working on a research project on documentary theatre at Tampere University. Since taking her doctoral degree 2004 she has published several articles and acted regularly as a visiting lecturer at the Teatre Academy, and at the Universities of Lapland, Tampere and Helsinki, where she also holds the title of docent in thea- tre studies. She studied scenography in 1980-85, worked as a full-time practicing designer 1983-2002, and was the professor of Stage Design in 2006-13 at the University of Industrial Arts, Helsinki (from 2010 at the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture). laurakgrondahl@gmail.com 86 Nordic Theatre Studies vol. 27: no. 2\n",

This article deals with the latter, and aims to analyse how Jews are represented there. It is suggested here that 1. these rep­ resentations are rendered comprehensible by analysing them in the light of the term coined by Zyg­ munt Bauman: allosemitism, which denotes that Jews are ‘other’. This article further suggests that 2. the representations of Jews featured in the lyrics cannot be made comprehensible without looking into the historical relations between American Jews and African Americans. According to Jeffrey\n",
      "Melnick, this relation is characterised by ‘robust ambivalences’. This article arrives at the conclusion that the representations of Jews draw on classical conspiratorial and economic antisemitic ideas that situate Jews within the realms of shadowy (economic and instrumental) power, but which at times can be understood as philosemitic, as Jews are represented as wealthy and influential role models.\n",

Problems can occur when there are diverse perceptions between teacher practice and student expectations. This study provides research-based evidence on 155 music students’ experiences of workload, stress, and coping in their interaction with teachers in higher education in Finland and the United Kingdom. The theoretical framework was informed by several theories in educational psychology research, such as the inﬂuence of teaching and learning environment on students’ perceived workload, and constructivist approach in teaching and learning music. The Edited by: data included 155 music students’ open-ended answers in the questionnaire and Sandra Fernandes, Portucalense University, Portugal interviews with 29 music students. The qualitative analysis was conducted through Reviewed by: the methodological framework of transcendental phenomenology. The ﬁndings illustrate Siw G.

Guadalupe López-Íñiguez Sibelius Academy, University of the Arts Helsinki, Finland Pamela Burnard Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge, UK Abstract Making sense of musicians’ professional learning pathways is of crucial importance to understanding their career progressions, their routes into creative employment, and the relevance of various policies to their professional lives. However, this is a far cry from understanding how critical reflection catalyzes diverse learning routes, especially when considering evidence originating from postgraduate musicians’ own accounts of their journeys into job creation. In this study, we invited five postgraduate classical musicians who were invested in professional learning through performance programs in higher education to contribute these types of personal perspectives. The article explores the value of postgraduate musicians’ own accounts of their journeys and illustrates how a more nuanced understanding of them can be arrived at through the use of visual-based tools, for example, Rivers of Musical Experience and Dixit Cards. This constructivist intervention prompted both group and individual critical reflections, as well as sense-making processes that enabled the participants to become more informed about the (typically overlooked or neglected) critical incidents that differently catalyze professional learning pathways. All of the participants articulated sociocultural influences that were situated along historical, present, and future points of departure and arrival, helping them to create meaning and understanding of themselves and their (at times unsettling) professional learning pathways. From the ensuing thematic analyses, we identified a commonality of themes across life phases with three key influential groups of people (parents, peers, and professionals) that strongly affected their professional learning pathways and learner identity- construction. The results indicate that the relationships between these phases and people are complex. The research illuminates the previously unexplored connection between the meaning-making trajectories that are instantiated through critical reflection, and adds to our understanding of the development of musicians’ professional learning pathways and learner identities.
